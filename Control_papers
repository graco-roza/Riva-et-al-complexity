Current theories of LL that are based on carbon optimisation principles are challenging to quantitatively assess because of uncertainty across species in the 'ageing rate:' the rate at which leaf photosynthetic capacity declines with age. Here, we present a meta-analysis of 49 species across temperate and tropical biomes, demonstrating that the ageing rate of photosynthetic capacity is positively correlated with the mass-based carboxylation rate of mature leaves. We assess an improved trait-driven carbon optimality model with in situ LL data for 105 species in two Panamanian forests. We show that our model explains over 40% of the cross-species variation in LL under contrasting light environment. Collectively, our results reveal how variation in LL emerges from carbon optimisation constrained by both leaf structural traits and abiotic environment.","[Xu, Xiangtao; Medvigy, David] Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Medvigy, David] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Joseph Wright, Stuart; Kitajima, Kaoru] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa 084303092, Panama; [Kitajima, Kaoru] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Wu, Jin] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Environm & Climate Sci Dept, New York, NY 11973 USA; [Albert, Loren P.; Saleska, Scott R.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Martins, Giordane A.] Natl Inst Amazonian Res INPA, Petropolis, Brazil; [Pacala, Stephen W.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Xu, XT (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.","xu.withoutwax@gmail.com","Albert, Loren/ABI-3168-2020; Wright, Stuart Joseph/M-3311-2013; Wu, Jin/P-7389-2019; Xu, Xiangtao/AAO-7401-2021; Saleska, Scott R/K-1733-2016; Wu, Jin/H-2582-2017; Kitajima, Kaoru/M-8521-2018","Albert, Loren/0000-0002-9674-6071; Wright, Stuart Joseph/0000-0003-4260-5676; Wu, Jin/0000-0001-8991-3970; Saleska, Scott R/0000-0002-4974-3628; Wu, Jin/0000-0001-8991-3970; Kitajima, Kaoru/0000-0001-6822-8536","US Department of Energy Terrestrial Ecosystem Science award [DE-SC0014363]; Andrew W.

Our objective was to relate variation in herpetofauna abundance to changes in habitat caused by a beetle used for Tamarix biocontrol (Diorhabda carinulata; Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and riparian restoration. During 2013 and 2014, we measured vegetation and monitored herpetofauna via trapping and visual encounter surveys (VES) at locations affected by biocontrol along the Virgin River in the Mojave Desert of the southwestern United States. Twenty-one sites were divided into four riparian stand types based on density and percent cover of dominant trees (Tamarix, Prosopis, Populus, and Salix) and presence or absence of restoration. Restoration activities consisted of mechanically removing non-native trees, transplanting native trees, and restoring hydrologic flows. Restored sites had three times more total lizard and eight times more yellow-backed spiny lizard (Sceloporus uniformis) captures than other stand types. Woodhouse's toad (Anaxyrus woodhousii) captures were greatest in unrestored and restored Tam-Pop/Sal sites. Results from VES indicated that herpetofauna abundance was greatest in the restored Tam-Pop/Sal site compared with the adjacent unrestored Tam-Pop/Sal site. Tam sites were characterized by having high Tamarix cover, percent canopy cover, and shade. Restored Tam-Pop/Sal sites were most similar in habitat to Tam-Pop/Sal sites. Two species of herpetofauna (spiny lizard and toad) were found to prefer habitat components characteristic of restored Tam-Pop/Sal sites. Restored sites likely supported higher abundances of these species because restoration activities reduced canopy cover, increased native tree density, and restored surface water.","[Mosher, Kent R.; Bateman, Heather L.] Arizona State Univ, Coll Letters & Sci, 6073 S Backus Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA","Bateman, HL (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Coll Letters & Sci, 6073 S Backus Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.","heather.bateman@gmail.com",NA,NA,"Bureau of Reclamation, Desert and Southern Rockies Landscape Conservation Cooperative","We acknowledge J.

The inclusion of ENA methods in Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) has insured their continued contribution to ecosystem-based management. In EwE, ENA-derived ecological conclusions are currently based on single values of ENA indices calculated from a unique input flow matrix. Here, we document an easy-to-use routine that allows EwE users to incorporate uncertainty in EwE input data into the calculation of ENA indices. This routine, named ENAtool, is a suite of Matlab functions that performs three main steps: (1) import of an existing Ecopath model and its associated parameter uncertainty values in the form of uncertainty intervals into Matlab; (2) generation of an ensemble of Ecopath models with the same structure as the original, and with parameter values varying based on the prescribed uncertainty limits; and (3) calculation of a set of 13 ENA indices for each ensemble member (one set of flow values) and of summary statistics across the whole ensemble. This novel routine offers the opportunity to calculate ENA indices ranges and confidence intervals, and thus to perform quantitative data analyses. An application of ENAtool on a pre-existing Ecopath model of the Bay of Biscay continental shelf is presented, with a focus on the robustness of previously published ENA-based ecological traits of this ecosystem when the newly introduced uncertainty values are added. We also describe the sensitivity of the ENAtool results to both the number of ensemble members used and to the uncertainty interval set around each input parameter. Ecological conclusions derived from EwE, particularly those regarding the comparison of structural and functional elements for a range of ecosystem types or the assessment of ecosystem properties along gradients of environmental conditions or anthropogenic disturbances, will gain in statistical interpretability.

In aquatic ecosystems, plant detritus has been considered the predominant form of such subsidies; however, while considered less abundant in many ecosystems, carrion represents subsidies with relatively rapid turnover and highly concentrated nutrient and energy release that can have strong and lasting effects on ecosystems. Carrion subsidies can be both autochthonous or allochthonous, and come in the form of natural senescence or disease-related non-consumptive mortality, phenology-based programed death (e.g., salmon spawning and death), or stochastic and episodic events (e.g., mass fish die-offs). All aquatic ecosystems have some level of non-consumptive mortality that provides a background level of carcasses to aquatic ecosystems, while others have a natural history of carrion resource subsidies (e.g., natural salmon-bearing streams), and some have only recently been exposed to phenology-based carrion subsidies (e.g., anthropogenic salmon introductions around the world). Many aquatic ecosystems experience episodic subsidies in the form of unexpected mass mortalities (e.g., eutrophication-, disease-, or climate-related mass die-offs) or have seasonally dependent pulses, like that of marine or lake snow in the form of zooplankton carcasses. The responses of ecosystems to these different histories and frequencies of carrion subsidies have often been independently investigated, with little effort to compare and bridge research boundaries in the broader context of resource subsidies. In this review, we provide a synthesis of how pulsed carrion nutrient and energy subsidies have widespread and lasting impacts on many aquatic ecosystems. We do this with a synthesis of literature from freshwater and marine ecosystems along three themes of how carrion is produced and decomposes: autochthonous and allochthonous necromass; phenology-based mortality; and stochastic and episodic mass mortality subsidies. Studies of charismatic megafauna carrion (e.g., whales) have described significant impacts in deep ocean systems, but much less is understood for other groups of animals. Quantifying the energy, nutrient, and foodweb effects of carrion is needed for more species and among habitats to more fully understand how ubiquitous forms of necromass contribute to aquatic ecosystem structure and function.","[Benbow, M.

Among these forest systems, the boreal forest is considered a 'tipping element' of the Earth's climate system. This forest biome plays a critical role in ecosystem services, structures and functions while being highly sensitive to drought stress. Although process-based models are important tools in ecological research, very few have yet been developed that integrate advanced physiological mechanisms to simulate drought-induced mortality in boreal forests. Accordingly, based on the process-based TRIPLEX model, this study introduces the new TRIPLEX-Mortality submodule for the Canadian boreal forests at the stand level, that for the first time successfully incorporates two advanced drought-induced physiological mortality mechanisms (i.e., hydraulic failure and carbon starvation). To calibrate and validate the model, 73 permanent sample plots (PSPs) were selected across Canada's boreal forests. Results confirm a good agreement between simulated mortality and mortality observations (R-2=0.79; P<0.01; IA=0.94), demonstrating good model performance in simulating drought-induced mortality in boreal forests. Sensitivity analysis indicated that parameter sensitivity increased as drought intensified, and the shape parameter (c) for calculating percentage loss of conductivity (PLC) was the most sensitive parameter (average SI = -3.51) to simulate tree mortality. Furthermore, the results of model input sensitivity analysis also showed that the model can capture changes in mortality under different drought scenarios. Consequently, our model is suitable for simulating drought-induced mortality in boreal forests while also providing new insight into improving model simulations for tree mortality and associated carbon dynamics in a progressively warmer and drier world.","[Liu, Qiuyu; Peng, Changhui] Univ Quebec, Inst Environm Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Case Postale 8888,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Schneider, Robert] Univ Quebec, UQAR, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Schneider, Robert] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, 351 St Joseph Blvd, Gatineau, PQ J8Y 3Z5, Canada; [Peng, Changhui; Liu, Zelin; Zhou, Xiaolu] Hunan Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Changsha 410081, Peoples R China; [Kneeshaw, Daniel] Univ Quebec, Ctr Forest Res, Case Postale 8888,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Peng, CH (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Inst Environm Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Case Postale 8888,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.","peng.changhui@uqam.ca",NA,NA,"NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); FRQNT (Fonds de recherche du Quebec)","This study was a part of research project recently funded by the NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada) and FRQNT (Fonds de recherche du Quebec) .

We investigated whether differences in thermoregulatory mechanisms, specifically evaporative cooling, explain the different behavior of three passerine species while stopping over in the Negev desert, Israel. We measured cutaneous water loss (CWL) under ambient conditions and the temperature of panting onset in an experimental setup. In addition, we performed behavioral observations of birds at a stopover site where we manipulated water availability. Blackcaps had slightly higher CWL at relatively low temperatures than Willow Warblers and Lesser Whitethroats. When considered relative to total body mass, however, Willow Warblers had the highest CWL of the three species. Blackcaps started panting at lower ambient temperature than the other two species. Taken together, these results suggest that Willow Warblers are the most efficient in cooling their body, possibly with the cost of needing to regain water by actively foraging during their staging. Lesser Whitethroats had a similar pattern, which was reflected in their slightly higher levels of activity and drinking behavior when water was available. However, in general the behavior of migratory species was not affected by the availability of water, and they were observed drinking rather rarely. Our results indicate that differences in thermoregulatory mechanisms might be at the basis of the evolution of different stopover strategies of migratory birds while crossing arid areas such as deserts.","[Paces, Bernhard; Waringer, Barbara M.] Univ Vienna, Fac Life Sci, Dept Bot & Biodivers Res, Div Trop Ecol & Anim Biodivers, Vienna, Austria; [Domer, Adi; Burns, Darren; Zvik, Yoram; Shochat, Eyal] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Zvik, Yoram] Hoopoe Ornithol & Ecol Ctr, Yeroham, Israel; [Wojciechowski, Michal S.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Biol & Vet Sci, Dept Vertebrate Zool & Ecol, Torun, Poland; [Sapir, Nir] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, Haifa, Israel; [Sapir, Nir] Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, Haifa, Israel; [Maggini, Ivan] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, Vienna, Austria","Maggini, I (corresponding author), Univ Vet Med Vienna, Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, Vienna, Austria.","ivan.maggini@vetmeduni.ac.at",NA,NA,"University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; University of Vienna; Needs-based Scholarship (Forderstipendium); Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [702/17]; Polish National Science Centre [2017/25/B/NZ8/00541]","This study was supported by a start-up grant (Profillinien) of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna to IM.

Evaluating the ecosystem response to these changes is therefore a top priority, particularly concerning water and carbon dynamics. The Pianosa Island is a well known test site where numerous environmental surveys have been performed to fully characterize the most typical vegetation type, Mediterranean macchia. A first measurement campaign concerning both vegetation and soil properties was performed in 2001, and was repeated in 2010 only for soil properties. Vegetation cover was characterized again by means of an aircraft high resolution LiDAR dataset taken in 2009. Additional medium and low spatial resolution satellite images (Landsat OLI and MODIS) and aircraft photos were recovered from various sources. The availability of these datasets offers a unique opportunity to develop and test a methodology capable of modelling and analyzing the water and carbon dynamics of Mediterranean macchia during the 2001-2010 decade. To this aim, simulation procedures integrating remotely sensed and ancillary data were first tuned towards the available observations of vegetation biomass and soil carbon content. These procedures were then applied to produce daily estimates of macchia actual evapotranspiration (AET), gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE), whose accuracy was assessed against corresponding eddy covariance flux tower observations taken in two years (2007-2008). The results obtained are satisfactory and support the capability of the modelling approach to reproduce both the water and carbon dynamics of macchia during the study decade. From an ecological viewpoint, both fluxes are increasing in this time period, mainly depending on similarly increasing spring rainfall. The macchia ecosystem behaves as a net sink of carbon, which is stored primarily in soil (congruent to 90%) and secondarily in vegetation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Land use changes are considered one of the key sources affecting the ecological water quality of the Guayas river basin. Therefore, we investigated the effect of land use on the ecological water quality both within direct vicinity and within a distance of 200 m from the sampling sites. We investigated which of three land use assessment methods (i.e. data retrieved from field protocols, from aerial pictures (Google maps) and from GIS data) is most suitable to quantify the impact of local land use on the ecological water quality and which key environmental variables influence the ecological water quality. To do so, we collected data on macroinvertebrates and environmental variables from 120 sampling sites throughout the river basin during an integrated sampling campaign. The Biological Monitoring Working Party adapted for Colombia (BMWP-Col) was calculated and used to assess the ecological water quality status of the river basin, based on macroinvertebrates. The relation between the BMWP-Col, local land use and other environmental variables was investigated using generalized linear models (GLMs) and sensitivity analyses. Based on multimodel comparison, the ecological water quality was best associated with the land use close to the sampling sites (field protocol, R-2 = 0.93, p < 0.05). Models involving land use assessed using aerial pictures, field protocols and GIS data were associated mainly with hydromorphological variables. However, the models incorporating land use evaluated on a larger spatial scale (i.e. Google maps and GIS maps) were also associated with physicalchemical variables. Although, the land use assessment based on aerial pictures using Google maps had the best outcome, a combined approach using field observation and aerial pictures can provide comprehensive land use data to the water management and provides the most complete information to define local land use of the sampling sites.","[Damanik-Ambarita, Minar Naomi; Boets, Pieter; Hanh Tien Nguyen Thi; Forio, Marie Anne Eurie; Everaert, Gert; Lock, Koen; Musonge, Peace Liz Sasha; Bennetsen, Elina; Gobeyn, Sacha; Tuan Long Ho; Goethals, Peter L.

In this study, we examined the interaction between herbivory and forage quality, structure and diversity at 12 kraals (abandoned for 22 years) paired with savanna control plots in Save Valley Conservancy, Zimbabwe. Plant diversity was not different between sites. Herbaceous cover was higher and woody species density lower on abandoned kraals than control plots. Furthermore, abandoned kraals had higher herbaceous productivity and foliar nutrient concentration for grasses than forbs. The abandoned kraals had higher concentration of soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), organic carbon (C) compared with control plots and a slightly acidic pH. Grasses were grazed more than forbs on nutrient-rich abandoned kraals. Only herbaceous biomass for grasses had a significant influence on the interaction between plants and herbivory. No clear relationships were observed between forage quality and herbivory and plant species diversity. Abandoned kraals provide patches of nutrient-rich forage, increasing savanna heterogeneity and in turn influence grazing patterns of large herbivores, and therefore influence ecosystem functioning. A conservation monitoring programme is recommended on such nutrient-rich patches as they serve as foraging-hotspots for herbivores in a dystrophic African semi-arid savanna.","[Chikorowondo, Gift; Muvengwi, Justice; Mbiba, Monicah] Bindura Univ Sci Educ, Dept Nat Resources Management, Private Bag 1020, Bindura, Zimbabwe; [Muvengwi, Justice; Mbiba, Monicah] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Gandiwa, Edson] Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Sch Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Private Bag 7724, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe","Chikorowondo, G (corresponding author), Bindura Univ Sci Educ, Dept Nat Resources Management, Private Bag 1020, Bindura, Zimbabwe.","gf8chiko@gmail.com","Gandiwa, Edson/I-2925-2019","Gandiwa, Edson/0000-0003-0708-350X; Muvengwi, Justice/0000-0001-9117-1865; Phantom, Ghost/0000-0001-8748-3380","Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) scholarshipDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) [A1395663]; Bindura University of Science Education [RB13/05/08]","Special thanks goes to the management of Save Valley Conservancy, Zimbabwe who allowed us to conduct this research on their property, Natural History Museum, Chemistry and Soil Research Institute and National University of Science and Technology, Zimbabwe for their invaluable assistance in identification of specimens and soil laboratory analyses This study was made possible through the financial support from Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) scholarship (A1395663) awarded to G.C and a research grant (RB13/05/08) from Bindura University of Science Education awarded to J.M, M.M and G.C.

Mangroves experience human pressure due to coastal development and are also subjected to environmental stress such as cyclones, tsunami, floods, and sea-level rise, often taking decades to recover from these stresses. We estimated changes in mangrove vegetation in the Ariankuppam estuary on the southeastern coast of peninsular India after two phenomenal perturbations, the 2004 tsunami and 2011 cyclone Thane. We compared land cover maps of mangroves from 2005, 2010, and 2011 with 2004 mangrove vegetation maps to detect change in areal extent of mangrove zones. We inventoried all stems >= 10 cm gbh in 34 quadrats (5 m x 5 m) prior to the 2011 cyclone, immediately following the cyclone, and eighteen months later to document damages and recovery. The site harbours 2988 trees ha(-1) for stems >= 10 cm gbh. We found four distinct mangrove zones in 2005 (15.54 ha), and five distinct mangrove zones in 2010 (41.73 ha) and 2011 (40.65 ha). The tsunami and subsequent activities such as dragging the boats swept ashore and dredging resulted in 48 % loss of mangroves. The increase in mangrove area observed during 2010 and 2011 was due to the recovery potential of Avicennia and restoration programs.

Colours also convey multiple channels of information. These channels are valuable for species identification, distinguishing individual quality, and revealing ecological or evolutionary aspects of animals' life. During recent years, the emerging interest in colour research has been raised in social hymenopterans such as ants, wasps, and bees. These insects provide important ecosystem services and many of those are model research organisms. Here we review benefits that various colour types give to social insects, summarize practical applications, and highlight further directions. Ants might use colours principally for camouflage, however the evolutionary function of colour in ants needs more attention; in case of melanin colouration there is evidence for its interrelation with thermoregulation and pathogen resistance. Colours in wasps and bees have confirmed linkages to thermoregulation, which is increasingly important in face of global climate change. Besides wasps use colours for various types of signalling. Colour variations of well chemically defended social insects are the mimetic model for unprotected organisms. Despite recent progress in molecular identification of species, colour variations are still widely in use for species identification. Therefore, further studies on variability is encouraged. Being closely interconnected with physiological and biochemical processes, insect colouration is a great source for finding new ecological indicators and biomarkers. Due to novel digital imaging techniques, software, and artificial intelligence there are emerging possibilities for new advances in this topic. Further colour research in social insects should consider specific features of sociality.","[Badejo, Oluwatobi; Skaldina, Oksana; Sorvari, Jouni] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm & Biol Sci, Yliopistonranta 1,POB 1627, Kuopio 70211, Finland; [Gilev, Aleksei] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Plant & Anim Ecol IPAE, Ural Ctr, 8 Marta St,202, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia; [Gilev, Aleksei] Ural Fed Univ, Russian Acad Sci, Inst Plant & Anim Ecol, Ural Branch, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia; [Sorvari, Jouni] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku 20014, Finland","Skaldina, O (corresponding author), Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm & Biol Sci, Yliopistonranta 1,POB 1627, Kuopio 70211, Finland.","oluwatobi.badejo@uef.fi; oksana.skaldina@uef.fi; gilev123@yandex.ru; jouni.sorvari@utu.fi","Gilev, Alexey/ABF-8742-2020","Gilev, Alexey/0000-0002-0404-6343; Badejo, Oluwatobi/0000-0001-9928-9059; Skaldina, Oksana/0000-0001-8674-7110","University of Eastern Finland (UEF) including Kuopio University Hospital","Open access funding provided by University of Eastern Finland (UEF) including Kuopio University Hospital.",NA,150,3,3,9,28,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0029-8549","1432-1939",NA,"OECOLOGIA","Oecologia","OCT",2020,"194","1-2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"27","40",NA,"10.1007/s00442-020-04738-1",NA,"SEP 2020",14,"Ecology","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","OA9KW","WOS:000565500300002",32876763,"Green Published, hybrid",NA,NA,"2021-09-23",NA

It boasts the highest elevation in the Atlantic Ocean and its northern and southern slopes have varying moisture and temperature gradients. Consequently, there are multiple spatially discrete vegetation zones, or biomes, recognized on the island that roughly follow elevation. We investigated the extent to which climatic variables as well as soil nitrogen isotope values (delta N-15) and weight %N influence spatial isotopic variability in C-3 plants during the rainy season and assessed the degree to which foliar carbon isotope discrimination (Delta(leaf)) and delta N-15 values are able to distinguish biomes. Mean Annual Precipitation explained 71% and 55% of the spatial variability in Delta(leaf) and delta N-15 values, respectively. Overall, foliar delta N-15 values tracked those in soils, and soil %N was negatively correlated with both soil and foliar delta N-15 values. However, there was considerable variability among co-occurring species, as well as among sites within the same biome, which obscured trends among biomes. As a result, only a few biomes were isotopically distinct: Broad-leaved evergreen forest and sub-desert coastal scrub on the northern slope, and summit scrub and sub-desert coastal scrub on the southern slope. Further investigation into the influence of coastal orientation, topography, plant physiology, soil characteristics, as well as seasonal and inter-annual climate variability on foliar isotope values would be fruitful. Nevertheless, these results provide baseline information for researchers seeking to interpret diet and mobility of animals and people, as well as environmental changes over time on Tenerife and other Macaronesian volcanic islands.","[Mosher, Stella Grace; Crowley, Brooke Erin; Yanes, Yurena; Diefendorf, Aaron Fuller] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Geol, Geol & Phys Bldg, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Crowley, Brooke Erin] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Anthropol, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Barone, Ruben] C Eduardo Zamacois 13-3 A, Santa Cruz De Tenerife 38005, Canary Islands, Spain; [Mosher, Stella Grace] Univ Utah, Dept Geog, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Crowley, BE (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Dept Geol, Geol & Phys Bldg, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.","brooke.crowley@uc.edu",NA,"Crowley, Brooke/0000-0002-8462-6806; Mosher, Stella/0000-0003-2761-9199","University of Cincinnati; Sigma Xi; United States of America National Science Foundation [EAR-1229114]","This research was funded by the University of Cincinnati, a Sigma Xi Grant in Aid of Research to SGM, and the United States of America National Science Foundation [grant No. EAR-1229114] to AFD and BEC.",NA,90,1,1,6,11,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1146-609X","1873-6238",NA,"ACTA OECOL","Acta Oecol.-Int.

The initial aerial baiting phase in the winters of 2010 and 2011 resulted in significant mortality of several native seabird species through primary and secondary ingestion of brodifacoum bait. A species of key concern is the northern giant petrel (Macronectes halli), which, although relatively abundant and increasing on Macquarie Island, is listed as threatened under Australian legislation and was one of the species most affected by poisoning. We use a Bayesian approach to estimate the total mortality and the response of the population to the poisoning event over the short- to medium-term. We then considered how population abundance might respond over the ensuing years. Projections of population trajectories suggest a greater than 50% probability of recovery to the pre-poisoning levels of 2009 breeding pairs by 2017.

In this study we examined the nutrient sink and potential nutrient sources of masting in a Bornean tropical forest. We investigated if nutrient flux in fine litter, tree stems, and soils changed temporally in response to intense flower and fruit production. Fifty-five litter traps were installed in a 2-ha plot at the onset of flowering (April 2010), and litter and nutrient fluxes were monitored for more than 4years (May 2010-December 2014). Wood cores of trunks and coarse roots of abundant species (Shorea spp.) and soil samples were collected in May 2010, September 2010, and September 2011 (coinciding with peak flowering, peak fruiting, and 1year after fruiting, respectively). The P and K fluxes in the total litter were significantly greater in the mast year (2010) than non-mast years, whereas the Mg, N, and Ca fluxes did not vary in relation to masting. In line with the nutrient fluxes, P and K concentrations in coarse roots of flowering individuals of S. multiflora decreased in September 2011. The present results suggest that tropical trees require extraordinary amounts of P and K for masting, and may retranslocate stored nutrients to meet the elevated nutrient demands for masting.","[Aoyagi, Ryota; Hidaka, Amane; Kitayama, Kanehiro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sakyo Ku, Kitashirakawa Oiwake Cho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Aoyagi, Ryota] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado 0843-03092, Panama City, Panama; [Imai, Nobuo] Tokyo Univ Agr, Dept Forest Sci, Setagaya Ku, Sakuragaoka 1-1-1, Tokyo 1568502, Japan; [Samejima, Hiromitsu] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Kamiyamaguchi 2108-11,Hayama Cho, Miura, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan","Aoyagi, R (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sakyo Ku, Kitashirakawa Oiwake Cho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.","aoyagi.ryota@gmail.com","Imai, Nobuo/AAR-7008-2020","Imai, Nobuo/0000-0002-8435-7693","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP22255002]; Global Environment Research Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [D-1006, 1-1403]","Permission to conduct this research was granted by the Sabah Forestry Department and Sabah Parks.

Although most studies of dryland biocrusts have been conducted in warm deserts, dryland biocrusts also exist in the Arctic, where they may be an important source of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) to nutrient-limited environments. In Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, wind-driven soil erosion has created a heterogeneous landscape where biocrusts dominate distinct patches of soil but are absent from the surrounding shrub and graminoid tundra. Prior to this study, little was known about the physical development and nutrient cycling of west Greenland biocrusts and their role in maintaining landscape heterogeneity. We characterized the physical properties, lichen assemblages, and nutrient concentrations of biocrusts and underlying soils along gradients in biocrust development and age. We found that biocrusts took 180 +/- 40years to fully develop and that biocrusts became thicker and soil penetration resistance increased as they developed. The N-fixing lichen Stereocaulon sp. was found throughout the study region at all stages of biocrust development. Natural N-15 abundance suggests that Stereocaulon sp. obtains about half of its N from biological fixation and that some biologically fixed N is incorporated into the underlying soils over time. Although the N and C concentrations of underlying soils increased slightly with biocrust development, nutrient concentrations under the most developed biocrusts remained low compared to the surrounding vegetated tundra. Our results suggest that biocrusts are a persistent feature and play an important role in maintaining the high spatial heterogeneity of the Kangerlussuaq terrestrial landscape.","[Heindel, Ruth C.; Governali, Francesca C.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Earth Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Spickard, Angela M.; Virginia, Ross A.] Dartmouth Coll, Environm Studies Program, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Virginia, Ross A.] Dartmouth Coll, Inst Arct Studies, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Heindel, Ruth C.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arct & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Heindel, RC (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Earth Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.; Heindel, RC (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Inst Arct & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.","ruth.heindel@colorado.edu",NA,NA,"Dartmouth Women in Science Project (WISP); National Science Foundation Office of Polar ProgramsNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [0801490, 1506155]; Sophomore Science Scholarship through Dartmouth Undergraduate Advising Research","We thank Robbie Score and the staff of CH2M Hill Polar Field Services for their logistics and field support in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland.

Often the interpretation of these functions is not easy and the nonspatial ecologist is in need of support. In order to make the analysis of spatial point patterns more accessible to ecologists, we introduced and tested a new graphical method, the mark-mark scatterplot. This plot visualises the marks of point pairs of inter-point distances r smaller than some small distance r(max). We tested the application of the mark-mark scatterplot by reconsidering three quite different tree patterns: a pattern of longleaf pine trees from the southern US which was strongly influenced by fires, a tropical tree pattern of the species Shorea congestiflora from Sri Lanka and a Scots pine pattern from Siberia (Russia). The new method yielded previously undetected cause-effect information on mark behaviour at short inter-point distances and thus improved the analysis with mark correlation functions as well as complemented the information they provided. We discovered important new correlations in clusters of trees at close proximity. The application of the mark-mark scatterplot will facilitate the interpretation of point process summary statistics and will make point process analysis more accessible to ecologists not specialized in point process statistics.","[Ballani, Felix; Stoyan, Dietrich] Bergakad Freiberg, Inst Stochast, Pruferstr 9, D-09596 Freiberg, Germany; [Pommerening, Arne] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Fac Forest Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Skogsmarksgrand 17, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden","Pommerening, A (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Fac Forest Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Skogsmarksgrand 17, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.","ballani@math.tu-freiberg.de; arne.pommerening@slu.se; stoyan@math.tu-freiberg.de",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25,4,4,2,19,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1574-9541","1878-0512",NA,"ECOL INFORM","Ecol.

What are the consequences of this process for wildlife, at the stand and landscape scales? This is the main question addressed in this paper. In five forested (Eucalyptus) landscapes (3 km-radius), with afforestation percentages of 12.6 to 38.6%, we analyzed patterns of diversity and abundance of birds and mammals. The different natural (forests, grasslands, wetlands) and anthropic (forest plantations) environments of the landscapes were sampled (11/2015-03/2017) using trap cameras (mean: 11 per environment) for mammals and the point count method (>= 25 points per environment) for birds. Grassland substitution by afforestation reduced locally (i.e., stand) the richness and abundance of bird species (68 and 90% respectively) and mammals (33 and 22% respectively). Open-habitat specialists were the most affected, while some close-habitat specialist or generalist species were detected within forest plantations. Despite the significant effects detected at the local level, the overall species richness at the landscape scale did not decrease with the increase of afforestation area in the assessed gradient. However, the richness of open-habitat birds decreased with afforestation area in the landscape. These results suggest that the conservation of medium/large mammals and generalist and forest birds could be feasible in forested landscapes that maintain at least 60% of natural habitats. But a significant fraction (37%) of grassland birds could be lost, if conservation measures are not taken.","[Brazeiro, A.; Cravino, A.; Fernandez, P.; Haretche, F.] Univ Republica, Grp Biodiversidad & Ecol Conservac, Inst Ecol & Ciencias Ambientales, Fac Ciencias, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay","Brazeiro, A (corresponding author), Univ Republica, Grp Biodiversidad & Ecol Conservac, Inst Ecol & Ciencias Ambientales, Fac Ciencias, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay.","brazeiro@fcien.edu.uy","Cravino, Antonio/Y-3935-2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,76,5,5,1,7,"ASOCIACION ESPANOLA ECOLOGIA TERRESTRE","MOSTOLES","C/ TULIPSAN S-N, DEPT BIOLOGIA & GEOLOGIA, UNIV REY JUAN CARLOS, MOSTOLES, 28933, SPAIN","1697-2473",NA,NA,"ECOSISTEMAS","Ecosistemas","SEP-DEC",2018,"27","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"48","59",NA,"10.7818/ECOS.1508",NA,NA,12,"Ecology","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","HG0OQ","WOS:000454646300007",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-09-23",NA

We addressed this knowledge gap by using a common garden experiment to examine whether genotypes of Populus trichocarpa varied in resistance to a leaf-blistering pathogen, Taphrina sp., and in the density of web-building spiders, the dominant group of predatory arthropods. In addition, we examined whether variation in spider density was explained by variation in the density and size of leaf blisters caused by Taphrina. We found that P. trichocarpa genotypes exhibited strong differences in their resistance to Taphrina and that P. trichocarpa genotypes that were more susceptible to Taphrina supported more web-building spiders, the dominant group of predatory arthropods. We suspect that this result is caused by blisters increasing the availability of suitable habitat for predators, and not due to variation in herbivores because including herbivore density as a covariate did not affect our models. Our study highlights a novel pathway by which genetic variation in pathogen resistance may affect higher trophic levels in arthropod communities.","[Slinn, Heather L.] Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, 1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Barbour, Matthew A.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T IZ4, Canada; [Crawford, Kerri M.] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Rodriguez-Cabal, Mariano A.] Univ Nacl Comahue, CONICET, INIBIOMA, Grp Ecol Invasiones, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Crutsinger, Gregory M.] Parrot Inc, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA; [Barbour, Matthew A.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Slinn, HL (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, 1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA.","hslinn@nevada.unr.edu",NA,"Slinn, Heather/0000-0003-0473-299X; Barbour, Matthew/0000-0001-7686-0400; Crawford, Kerri/0000-0003-4421-2243","NSERC DiscoveryNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","Many thanks to the Crutsinger lab and S.

HR in plants that conduct crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), however, remains poorly investigated, as does the effect of HR on transpiration in different vegetation associations (i.e., tree-grass, CAM-grass, and tree-CAM associations). We have developed a mechanistic model to investigate the net direction and magnitude of HR at the patch scale for tree-grass, CAM-grass, and tree-CAM associations at the growing season to yearly timescale. The modeling results show that deep-rooted CAM plants in CAM-grass associations could perform hydraulic lift at a higher rate than trees in tree-grass associations in a relatively wet environment, as explained by a significant increase in grass transpiration rate in the shallow soil layer, balancing a lower transpiration rate by CAM plants. By comparison, trees in tree-CAM associations may perform hydraulic descent at a higher rate than those in tree-grass associations in a dry environment. Model simulations also show that hydraulic lift increases the transpiration of shallow-rooted plants, while hydraulic descent increases that of deep-rooted plants. CAM plants transpire during the night and thus perform HR during the day. Based on these model simulations, we suggest that the ability of CAM plants to perform HR at a higher rate may have different effects on the surrounding plant community than those of plants with C-3 or C-4 photosynthetic pathways (i.e., diurnal transpiration).","[Yu, Kailiang; Foster, Adrianna] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Yu, KL (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.","ky9hc@virginia.edu",NA,"Foster, Adrianna/0000-0002-7382-0013","China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council","This study is supported by China Scholarship Council.

To explore the dynamics of growth in migratory bull trout, one of the models, the von Bertalanffy model, was also fitted based on age estimates derived from annuli and growth increments on pelvic fin ray sections for three juvenile outmigration age groups. Among five growth models evaluated, four models fitted to the age-length data described the fish growth for ages 3 to 11 comparably well. Only a model that exhibited positive growth acceleration as age progressed fitted the data less effectively. Growth was significantly (P < 0.001) related to the age of outmigration from natal streams (1-3 years). Migratory bull trout were found to reach maturation at ages 4-6; the common age-4 maturation was younger than most comparable studies. All mature fish studied reared for 2-3 years in downriver or reservoir habitat. As the adult population size has continued to increase since harvest closure in 1994, further research should be directed towards understanding the trade-offs between these increasing numbers of adult fish and growth, survival, migration, and maturation schedules.","[Erhardt, John M.; Scarnecchia, Dennis L.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Erhardt, JM (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.","jerhardt@usgs.gov",NA,NA,"daho Department of Fish and Game","We thank colleagues at the University of Idaho Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources for their efforts which contributed to this study.

The duration of an outbreak is expected to depend on the subsequent development of this abundance; however, prediction is nontrivial due to the complexity of the gerbil-plague system. The aim of this study was to investigate how the duration of outbreaks depends on different types of host population dynamics generated from: a cyclic model; an autoregressive model giving irregular fluctuations; and a simple model with uncorrelated fluctuations. For each model, outbreak duration was studied under various levels of mean and variability of host abundance. Its focus on the effect of different gerbil dynamics sets this study apart from the few published studies on diseases in dynamic host populations. Plague outbreaks were simulated in a cellular automaton model based on statistical analysis of archived records of plague and host abundance. Temporal autocorrelation was found to make outbreak duration less sensitive to changes in mean abundance than uncorrelated fluctuations. Cyclicity had little effect on the mean duration of outbreaks, but resulted in a multimodal distribution. For all three types of gerbil dynamics, increased variability in gerbil abundance reduced the duration of outbreaks when the mean abundance was high (paralleling results on the risk of species extinction in fluctuating environments), but increased their duration when the mean abundance was lower. Spatial heterogeneity was briefly tested and produced longer outbreaks than the homogenous case. The results are relevant to predicting plague activity in populations of great gerbils.","[Viljugrein, Hildegunn] Norwegian Vet Inst, N-0106 Oslo, Norway; [Heier, Lise; Viljugrein, Hildegunn] Univ Oslo, CEES, Dept Biosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Storvik, Geir O.] Univ Oslo, Dept Math, N-0316 Oslo, Norway","Heier, L (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, CEES, Dept Biosci, POB 1066 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.","lh@liseheier.net","Viljugrein, Hildegunn/N-6657-2015","Storvik, Geir Olve/0000-0001-8198-1426",NA,NA,NA,47,2,2,0,12,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1438-3896","1438-390X",NA,"POPUL ECOL","Popul.

The experiment was based on a completely randomized design (CRD) with four replications. The plants were collected randomly at three different phenological stages, three leaves (ZGS13), heading emergence (ZGS60) and ripened (ZGS99) stages. The results revealed that in all three growth stages the studied parameters were significantly different amoung various populations. According to the results, populations were divided into three, six and five groups in accordance with the studied stages, respectively. PCA analysis indicated that plant biomass, plant height and spike length were the most effective traits for population distinction. Biomass showed positive and significant correlation with other traits except for the days to ripen. Furthermore, seed weight and biomass were strongly correlated. Mantel test showed no significant correlation between population characteristics and geographic distances. Generally, populations and groups with the maximum similarity belonged to comparable latitudes. Populations grown in similar annual mean temperature; mean August and mean January temperatures, and annual precipitation showed the maximum similarity. Ultimately we may conclude that phenotypic populations may be valuable features of wild barley populations in employing the most suitable weed management approach.","[Hosseini, Mojtaba] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran; [Ghorbani, Reza; Mohassel, Mohammad Hassan Rashed] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Agr, Dept Agrotechnol, Mashhad, Iran; [Yassaie, Mohsen] AREEO, Fars Agr & Nat Resources Res & Educ Ctr, Seed & Plant Improvement Res Dept, Shiraz, Iran","Ghorbani, R (corresponding author), Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Agr, Dept Agrotechnol, Mashhad, Iran.","reza-ghorbani@um.ac.ir",NA,"Hosseini, mojtaba/0000-0001-7539-6730; Hosseini, Mojtaba/0000-0002-9942-529X","Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran for financial support.

The present study aimed at modelling the distributions of these two cate-gories of species and find the significant environmental variables to explain these distributions. Field sampling was performed in this region in 2014 resulting in enough data for modelling the distribution of three species, one native (the white-clawed crayfish, Austropotamobius pallipes) and two introduced from North America (the spiny cheek crayfish, Faxonius limosus, and the signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus). Environmental data were collected from different sources and included altitude, slope, land cover, and several water quality measures such as nitrate and ammonium concentrations. The two introduced species showed different influential variables compared to the white-clawed crayfish. Currently, it is unlikely that the two introduced species affect negatively the native white-clawed crayfish. The most important threat for this species seems to be the increase of temperature caused by global warming. If the introduced species continue to spread, they may provide a synergy with the increase of temperature and threaten the native populations. It appears crucial to continue the monitoring of these species in this area. Future investigations should be carried out to understand the relationships between present crayfish spatial distribution and pathogens carried by alien species as these might be critical factors mediating the interactions among these species.","[Piyapong, Chantima] Burapha Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Chon Buri 20131, Thailand; [Tattoni, Clara; Ciolli, Marco] Univ Trento, Lab Ecol, Dipartimento Ingn Civile Ambientale & Meccan, Trento, Italy; [Tattoni, Clara] Univ Firenze, DAGRI Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Agr Alimentari Am, Florence, Italy; [Ciolli, Marco] Univ Trento, Ctr Agr Food & Environm C3A, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, Italy; [Dembski, Samuel] Agence Francaise Biodivers, Paris, France; [Paradis, Emmanuel] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, EPHE, ISEM,IRD, Montpellier, France","Paradis, E (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, EPHE, ISEM,IRD, Montpellier, France.","Emmanuel.Paradis@ird.fr","Tattoni, Clara/AAG-6917-2020; Ciolli, Marco/D-8613-2014","Tattoni, Clara/0000-0003-1555-5669; Ciolli, Marco/0000-0001-8370-9039","French-Thai Cooperation Program in Higher Education and Research (2015-2016); ASEA-UNINET [ICM-2016-03779]","We wish to thank all the agents working at the French Agency for Biodiversity who performed the crayfish observations, Leopold Fureder for welcoming the first author in the University of Innsbruck, and Yorick Reyjol for help to obtain the data analysed in this study.

Yet, in many ways, microbes are more appropriate for testing this and other ecological theories due to their small size and short generation times that translate to an ease of replication. We used a natural experimental system of isolated host islands to test the generality of the theory of island biogeography. Specifically, we tested whether ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) richness increased with tree size and decreased with distance from forest in a subalpine basin in Yosemite National Park for two congeneric pine species, Pinus albicaulis and Pinus contorta. We determined EMF richness with next-generation sequencing, measured the size and age of each tree island (n = 40), and calculated geographic distances from each tree to the nearest forest edge. We found that EMF richness increased with island size (as measured by tree volume) and tree age for both pine species and decreased with distance from forest edge for P. albicaulis. Thus, we show the applicability of the theory to microbial symbionts in harsh, dry, and likely non-equilibrium systems.

Trait-based models of ecological communities typically assume intraspecific variation in functional traits is not important, although such variation can change species trait rankings along gradients in resources and environmental conditions, and thus influence community structure and function. 2. We examined the degree of intraspecific relative to interspecific variation, and reaction norms of 11 functional traits for 57 forest understorey plant species, including: intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE), Delta N-15, five leaf traits, two stem traits and two root traits along gradients in light, nitrogen, moisture and understorey cover. 3. Our results indicate that interspecific trait variation exceeded intraspecific variation by at least 50% for most, but not all traits. Intraspecific variation in Delta N-15, iWUE, leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and root traits was high (47-70%) compared with most leaf traits and stem traits (13-38%). 4. Delta N-15 varied primarily along gradients in abiotic conditions, while light and understorey cover were relatively less important. Intrinsic water-use efficiency was related primarily to light transmission, reflecting increases in photosynthesis relative to stomatal conductance. Leaf traits varied mainly as a function of light availability, with some reaction norms depending on understorey cover. Plant height increased with understorey cover, while stem-specific density was related primarily to light. Resources, environmental conditions and understorey cover did not contribute strongly to the observed variation in root traits. 5. Gradients in resources, environmental conditions and competition all appear to control intraspecific variability in most traits to some extent. However, our results suggest that species cross-over (i.e. trait rank reversals) along the gradients measured here are generally not a concern. 6. Intraspecific variability in understorey plant species traits can be considerable. However, trait data collected under a narrow range of environmental conditions appears sufficient to establish species rankings and scale between community and ecosystem levels using trait-based models. Investigators may therefore focus on obtaining a sufficient sample size within a single set of conditions rather than characterizing trait variation across entire gradients to optimize sampling efforts.","[Burton, Julia I.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Perakis, Steven S.] US Geol Survey, Forest & Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Corvallis, OR USA; [McKenzie, Sean C.] Montana State Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Lawrence, Caitlin E.] Oregon State Univ, Inst Nat Resources, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Puettmann, Klaus J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Burton, JI (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA.","julia.burton@usu.edu","Burton, Julia/C-8395-2009","Burton, Julia/0000-0002-3205-8819","U.S. Bureau of Land Management [L15AC00009, L16AC00284]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, McIntire Stennis project [229410, UTA01305]","This research was supported with funding from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (Financial Assistance Agreement No. L15AC00009 to K.J.P. and J.I.B. and L16AC00284 to J.I.B.).

Previous studies indicated grazing showed various impacts on small rodents; however, most studies were conducted over 1-2 years without controlling for confounding factors such as immigration/emigration and predation in rodents. Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) are generally recognized as pests because of food overlap with domestic herbivores, but are also important for biodiversity conservation because they provide nests or food to many birds. Fully understanding the ecological relationship between domestic herbivores and small mammals is essential to making ecosystem management decisions. To address these needs, we carried out a field experiment during the period 2010-2013 to assess the effects of sheep grazing on vegetation and the population density of Brandt's voles along a gradient of three grazing intensities by using 12 large-scale enclosures. Responses of Brandt's voles to livestock grazing varied with grazing intensity and year. As compared to the control group, sheep grazing had no effect on vole abundance in the first year but an overall negative effect on vole abundance in the following 3 years. Successive grazing caused decreases in survival and male body mass of voles, but had no significant effect on fecundity. Negative effects of grazing were associated with a grazing-induced deterioration in both food quantity (reflected by biomass and cover of less-preferred plants), and food quality (measured by tannin and total phenol content). Our findings highlight the urgent need for more flexible management of yearly rotational grazing to optimize livestock production while maintaining species diversity and ecosystem health.","[Li, Guoliang; Yin, Baofa; Wan, Xinrong; Zhang, Zhibin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Guoliang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yin, Baofa; Wei, Wanhong] Yangzhou Univ, Coll Biosci & Biotechnol, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guiming] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Aquaculture, Starkville, MS 39762 USA; [Krebs, Charles J.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Zhang, ZB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.","Zhangzb@ioz.ac.cn","Wang, Guiming/E-4582-2011; Li, Guoliang/AAA-9738-2019; Wang, Guiming/O-8925-2019","Wang, Guiming/0000-0001-5002-0120; Wang, Guiming/0000-0001-5002-0120","Ministry of Science and Technology [2007CB109100]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB11050000]","We thank the Maodeng Pasture of Xilinhot City and the Grassland Station of Xilingol League for their kind help in our field experiments.

The genus Leucadendron (Proteaceae) is an ideal candidate for comparative germination studies, comprising 85 species with a mixture of contrasting life-history traits (killed by fire vs able to resprout; serotinous vs geosporous) and seed morphologies (nutlets vs winged achenes). Individual and combined effects of heat and smoke on seed germination of 40 species were quantified in the laboratory, and Bayesian inference applied to distinguish biologically meaningful treatment effects from non-zero, but biologically trivial, effects. Three germination syndromes were identified based on whether germination was dependent on, enhanced by, or independent of direct fire cues (heat and smoke). Seed storage location was the most reliable predictor of germination syndromes, with soil-stored seeds c. 80% more likely to respond to direct fire cues (primarily smoke) than canopy-stored seeds. Notable exceptions were L. linifolium, with an absolute requirement for smoke to germinate (the third serotinous species so reported), and two other serotinous species with smoke-enhanced germination. Nutlet-bearing species, whether serotinous or geosporous, were c. 70% more likely to respond to fire cues than winged seeds, but there was no evidence for an effect of phylogeny or persistence strategy on germination. This comprehensive account of seed germination characteristics and identification of germination syndromes and their predictors, supports propagation, conservation and restoration initiatives in this iconic fynbos genus and other fire-prone shrubs with canopy or soil-stored seeds.","[Newton, Rosemary J.; Gomez-Barreiro, Pablo] Royal Bot Gardens Kew, Conservat Sci, Ardingly RH17 6TN, W Sussex, England; [Mackenzie, Berin D.

Indeterminate growth creates a persistent conflict with reproduction, as growth may enhance future reproduction, but diverts resources from current reproduction. Little is known about allocation trade-offs in mammals with indeterminate growth. We studied growth and reproduction in adult female eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), an iteroparous mammal with indeterminate growth. Allocation trajectories varied with age and size: for 4-year-old females, fecundity increased from 30 to 82% from shortest to average-sized individuals. Older females had high fecundity regardless of size. The smallest females grew 30% more annually than average-sized females, but females that reached average size at an older age had lower growth rates. Environmental conditions affected allocation to size and reproduction. Rainy springs increased fecundity from 61 to 84% for females that had previously reproduced, but rainy winters reduced leg growth. Females in better relative condition grew 40% more than average, whereas most young of females below average relative condition failed to survive to 10 months of age. These results highlight an age-specific trade-off between growth and reproduction. Tall young females benefit from a smaller trade-off between somatic growth and early fecundity than shorter females of the same age, but older females appear to favor reproduction over growth regardless of size. Our study highlights how individual heterogeneity determines trade-offs between life-history components. We speculate that cohort effects affect age-specific reproductive success in this long-lived mammal.","[Quesnel, Louise; King, Wendy J.; Festa-Bianchet, Marco] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [King, Wendy J.; Coulson, Graeme; Festa-Bianchet, Marco] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Quesnel, L (corresponding author), Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada.","Louise.Quesnel@USherbrooke.ca",NA,"King, Wendy/0000-0002-5832-0088","National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Fonds de Recherche Quebecois en Nature et Technologies; Ministere de l'Education, du Loisir et du Sport du Quebec","We thank all students, collaborators, and assistants who helped us monitor kangaroos at Wilsons Promontory National Park, in particular Allison MacKay and Dave Forsyth.

Efforts have been made in the reversal of these effects, with much of the literature reporting a mixture of findings. At a localised scale, these efforts have been noticeable with RSPB Hope Farm observing a 200% increase in bird territory numbers from 2000 to 2012, achieved with the wide implementation of agri-environment schemes (AES) on the farm. We aimed to investigate the spatio-temporal drivers of territory density in four hedgerow specialist bird species using a thirteen year (2000-2012) dataset of hedgerow management, in-field cropping and field boundary habitat records. Territory maps were used to calculate territory counts for each hedgerow across the time period. Generalised Linear Mixed Models were used to model territory counts for each habitat variable. These findings demonstrate that for Emberiza citrinella, Carduelis cannabina and Sylvia communis, presence of oilseed rape (OSR) is a strong predictor of higher territory numbers, leading to a doubling in territory density compared to absence of OSR. However, tree presence in hedgerows was a negative predictor of territory numbers for these species. Opposing trends were observed for Carduelis chloris, which exhibited significantly greater territory numbers in roadside hedgerows, hedges with trees and when adjacent fields were not sown with a main crop. Management of hedges was a weak predictor of S. communis territories. This demonstrates that crop type, AES features, tree presence and location of hedgerows are drivers of farmland bird territory numbers. These findings validate the usefulness of more sustainable, wildlife-friendly farming under previous CAP rules and have important implications for post-Brexit farming policy, such as the Agriculture Bill.","[Tresise, Megan E.; Biffi, Sofia; Firbank, Les G.] Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Field, Rob H.] RSPB, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, England","Tresise, ME (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.","bs15m2t@leeds.ac.uk",NA,"Tresise, Megan/0000-0002-7641-1792","University of Leeds, United Kingdom","The authors would like to give thanks to the team at RSPB Hope Farm who have been collecting the data used in this paper for the past 20 years.

For example, zooplankton prey on the infectious stage of the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a pathogen responsible for amphibian population declines and extinctions worldwide. Predation on parasites is predicted to influence community structure and function, and affect disease risk, but relatively few studies have explored its consequences empirically. We investigated interactions among Rana cascadae tadpoles, zooplankton, and Bd in a fully factorial experiment in outdoor mesocosms. We measured growth, development, survival, and infection of amphibians and took weekly measurements of the abundance of zooplankton, phytoplankton (suspended algae), and periphyton (attached algae). We hypothesized that zooplankton might have positive indirect effects on tadpoles by consuming Bd zoospores and by consuming phytoplankton, thus reducing the shading of a major tadpole resource, periphyton. We also hypothesized that zooplankton would have negative effects on tadpoles, mediated by competition for algal resources. Mixed-effects models, repeated-measures ANOVAs, and a structural equation model revealed that zooplankton significantly reduced phytoplankton but had no detectable effects on Bd or periphyton. Hence, the indirect positive effects of zooplankton on tadpoles were negligible when compared to the indirect negative effect mediated by competition for phytoplankton. We conclude that examination of host-pathogen dynamics within a community context may be necessary to elucidate complex community dynamics.","[Buck, Julia C.; Blaustein, Andrew R.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Scholz, Katharina I.] Univ Hohenheim, Agr Sci, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Rohr, Jason R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Buck, JC (corresponding author), Sam Houston State Univ, Texas Res Inst Environm Studies, Huntsville, TX 77341 USA.","julia.buck@gmail.com","Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021","Buck, Julia/0000-0003-3202-7665","National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0802268]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship; Oregon State University Zoology Research Fund; Society of Wetland Scientists; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R01TW010286] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank M.

We studied how the eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua) is affected by fishing and environmental variation by using a newly developed single species state-space model. Survey data and auxiliary environmental data were used to estimate the model parameters. The model was then used to predict future development of the eastern Baltic cod under different fishing mortalities and abiotic conditions. Abiotic condition was represented by an index: reproductive volume which is the volume of water suitable (in terms of salinity and oxygen content) for the successful development of the early life stages of Baltic cod. The model included direct density dependence, fishing, and a lagged effect of reproductive volume. Our analysis showed that fishing rate is approximately three times more important than reproductive volume in explaining the population dynamics. Furthermore, our model suggests either under- or over-compensatory dynamics depending on the reproductive volume and long term catch levels. It follows that fishing can either reduce or increase temporal oscillations of the cod stock depending on whether the dynamics is over- or undercompensatory, respectively. The sustainable level of fishing rate is however dependent on reproductive volume. Our model predicts a dual role of fishing rate, stabilizing when reproductive volume is high and destabilizing when it is low. Exploitation rate may therefore increase or decrease the risk of the population of cod dropping below a given biomass reference point depending on the environmental conditions, which has practical implications for fisheries management.","[Wikstrom, Anders; Jonzen, Niclas] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Theoret Populat Ecol & Evolut Grp, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Knape, Jonas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Casini, Michele; Cardinale, Massimiliano; Hjelm, Joakim] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, SE-45330 Lysekil, Sweden; [Gardmark, Anna] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Coastal Res, Dept Aquat Resources, SE-74242 Oregrund, Sweden","Wikstrom, A (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Theoret Populat Ecol & Evolut Grp, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.","anders.wikstrom@biol.lu.se","Gardmark, Anna/AAC-3909-2021","Hjelm, Joakim/0000-0001-8423-8873; Knape, Jonas/0000-0002-8012-5131; Casini, Michele/0000-0003-4910-5236","Swedish Research Council FORMASSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [2007-549]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission","A.W. was financially supported by the Swedish Research Council FORMAS (Grant No 2007-549 to N.J), and N.J. is holding a research fellowship from the Swedish Research Council.

Increased propagule pressure (e.g., more founding individuals) usually enhances colonization; however, this pattern may be driven by purely numeric effects, population genetic diversity effects, or both. To determine the independent and interactive effects of propagule pressure and genetic diversity, we conducted a seed addition experiment in the field using the ruderal annual Arabidopsis thaliana. Propagule pressure treatments spanned five levels, from 32 to 960 seeds per 0.25-m(2) plot. Founder populations were composed of one, four, or eight genotypes and exposed to ambient or reduced levels of interspecific competition. Genotype monocultures were included to quantify additive vs. non-additive effects. Populations were followed for three generations, with abundance, population persistence and genotype retention (the proportion of introduced genotypes persisting over time) as the major response variables. Increased propagule pressure enhanced abundance immediately following introduction, particularly where nutrient availability was high and competition reduced. Greater propagule pressure also increased the likelihood of population persistence and genotype retention through three generations. However, most populations experienced rapid abundance declines over time, yielding no relationship between propagule pressure and third-generation abundance across persisting populations. Under reduced competition, increased genetic diversity led to a marginal increase in persistence through the third generation that was more pronounced, and statistically significant, in low nutrient conditions. Genetic diversity did not affect persistence through the first generation, thus indicating that genetic diversity effects strengthened over time. Nevertheless, genotypic mixture populations fell short of expectations based on performance in monocultures (negative non-additive effects). Increased genetic diversity was also associated with abundance declines, largely due to one particularly high-performing genotype in the lowest diversity treatments (i.e., genotypic identity effects). Overall, our results indicate that increases in both propagule pressure and genetic diversity can enhance colonization success but are highly context dependent. They also highlight novel ways in which both factors can impact the retention of introduced genetic diversity over time. Our findings pinpoint the determinants of a fundamental population process and have key implications for applications where enhanced or suppressed colonization is desired, including ecological restoration and invasive species management.","[Hovick, Stephen M.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Whitney, Kenneth D.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Hovick, SM (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.","hovick.2@osu.edu","Hovick, Stephen/Y-1530-2019; Whitney, Kenneth D/B-2971-2011","Hovick, Stephen/0000-0003-1774-9686; Whitney, Kenneth D/0000-0002-2523-5469","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1146203, DEB 1257965]; Ohio State UniversityOhio State University","We thank the Katy Prairie Conservancy for hosting the research.

This study aims to discuss the validity of introducing restrictions on the catch of Coregonus migratorius (Georgi, 1775) with a forecast of the likely environmental consequences of doing so. Discussion. We show the results of the analysis of the assessment of the state of C. migratorius stocks and the reasons for their decline. We indicate that the biostatistical and hydroacoustical methods for estimating fish numbers, which are traditionally used to substantiate allowable catches, have some disadvantages and limitations. We consider unrecorded catches and unfavourable natural and climatic environmental factors to be reasons for the decline in C. migratorius stocks. We discuss ecological and anthropogenic factors of changes in stocks of this commercially important species for the region. We show the anticipated ecological effects of currently established limits. Conclusion. The results of changes in the modelling of the number and age composition of fish with different protection strategies indicate that maintaining a low level of replenishment stock the limits would not increase commercial stocks of C. migratorius. Restrictions imposed on the commercial and amateur fishing would significantly increase environmental risks through increase of poaching (including during the spawning period) as well as as a consequence of amateur fishing of other commercially valuable fish species.","[Anoshko, Pavel N.; Makarov, Mikhail M.; Zorkaltsev, Valery, I; Denikina, Natalia N.; Dzyuba, Elena, V] Russian Acad Sci, Limnol Inst, Siberian Branch, Irkutsk, Russia","Makarov, MM (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Limnol Inst, Siberian Branch, Lab Interdisciplinary Environm Econ Res & Technol, 3 A-I 278,Ulan Batorskaya St, Irkutsk 664009, Russia.","mmmsoft@hlserver.lin.irk.ru",NA,NA,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [0279-2019-0003];  [190700322]","This study was supported by the State Project No. 0279-2019-0003 and Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) project No. 190700322.",NA,36,0,0,2,3,"KAMERTON PUBLISHER","MOSCOW","A-YA 58, MOSCOW, 107014, RUSSIA","1992-1098","2413-0958",NA,"S RUSS-ECOL DEV","South Russ.-Ecol.

However, its effects on dispersal should depend on dispersal syndromes, i.e. how dispersal covaries with phenotypic traits, because these syndromes can drastically alter dispersal and subsequent ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Our comprehension of whether environmental factors such as habitat fragmentation generate and/or modify dispersal syndromes (i.e. conditional dispersal syndromes) is therefore key for biodiversity forecasting. Here we tested whether habitat fragmentation modulates dispersal syndromes by experimentally manipulating matrix harshness, a critical feature of habitat fragmentation, in ciliate microcosms. We found evidence for dispersal syndromes involving multiple traits linked to morphology (elongation and size), movement (velocity and linearity) and demography (growth rate and maximal population density). More importantly, these syndromes were modified by matrix harshness, with increased differences between residents and dispersers in morphology and movement traits, and decreased differences in growth rate as the matrix became increasingly harsh. Our findings thus reveal that habitat fragmentation can mediate the intensity and form of dispersal syndromes, a context-dependence that could have important consequences for ecological and evolutionary dynamics under environmental changes.","[Jacob, Staffan; Laurent, Estelle; Morel-Journel, Thibaut; Schtickzelle, Nicolas] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Biodivers Res Ctr, Croix Sud 4,L7-07-04, BE-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Jacob, Staffan] CNRS UPS, Stn Ecol Theor & Expt, UMR 5321, 2 Route CNRS, FR-09200 Moulis, France","Jacob, S (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Biodivers Res Ctr, Croix Sud 4,L7-07-04, BE-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.; Jacob, S (corresponding author), CNRS UPS, Stn Ecol Theor & Expt, UMR 5321, 2 Route CNRS, FR-09200 Moulis, France.","jacobstaffan@gmail.com",NA,"Morel-Journel, Thibaut/0000-0002-9124-2894","F.R.S.-FNRSFonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS [U.N035.16]; UCL-FSR; Move-In-Louvain Marie Curie Action postdoctoral fellowships; scientific environment of the Laboratoire d'Excellence entitled TULIP [ANR-10-LABX-41]","This study was supported by the F.R.S.-FNRS (equipment grant U.N035.16) and UCL-FSR.

Therefore, it is crucial to assess the relative importance of deterministic vs. stochastic factors producing remnant vegetation to understand their function in the persistence of fire-sensitive plants. Vegetation remnants (areas within the landscape that have not burned for a considerable amount of time) may occur stochastically or in more predictable locations (fire refuges) where physical conditions decrease fire severity. Our aim was to determine if remnant forests of the fire-sensitive conifer Austrocedrus chilensis are associated with biophysical attributes that allow persistence in a fire-prone Patagonian landscape. We conducted a multi-scale approach, determining attributes of forest remnants and their surroundings (matrices) through remote sensing and field-based biophysical and functional characteristics, and quantifying how tree survival probability relates to microsite conditions. Trees within remnants displayed abundant fire scars, were twofold older and had threefold larger growth rates than matrix trees. Remnants were associated with high rocky cover and elevated topographical positions. Tree survival increased in hilltops, eastern aspects, and with sparse vegetation. Trees within remnants experienced severe reductions in growth during droughts. Our results suggest that A. chilensis remnants are mainly the result of refuges, where environmental conditions increase fire survival, but also increase susceptibility to drought. A trade-off between fire survival and drought vulnerability may imply that under increasing drought and fire severity, locations that in the past have served as refuges may reduce their ability to allow the persistence of fire-sensitive taxa.","[Landesmann, Jennifer B.; Gowda, Juan H.; Kitzberger, Thomas] Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Lab Ecotono, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Garibaldi, Lucas A.] UNRN, CONICET, Sede Andina, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Landesmann, JB (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Lab Ecotono, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.","jennifer.landesmann@gmail.com","Garibaldi, Lucas A/D-7302-2013; Gowda, Juan/ABE-6184-2020; Kitzberger, Thomas/H-9209-2015","Gowda, Juan/0000-0001-5481-3793; Kitzberger, Thomas/0000-0002-9754-4121; Garibaldi, Lucas Alejandro/0000-0003-0725-4049","Ministerio de Agricultura, Ganaderia y Pesca [BIRF 7520, PIA 10058, PIA 12055]; CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)","We thank Juan Manuel Morales for insightful comments on the manuscript and Maria Laura Suarez for her help in the tree chronology and correlation function analysis.

Drylands represent our planet's largest terrestrial biome and, due to their extensive area, maintain large stocks of carbon (C). Accordingly, understanding how dryland C cycling will respond to climate change is imperative for accurately forecasting global C cycling and future climate. However, it remains difficult to predict how increased temperature will affect dryland C cycling, as substantial uncertainties surround the potential responses of the two main C fluxes: plant photosynthesis and soil CO2 efflux. In addition to a need for an improved understanding of climate effects on individual dryland C fluxes, there is also notable uncertainty regarding how climate change may influence the relationship between these fluxes. 2. To address this important knowledge gap, we measured a growing season's in situ photosynthesis, plant biomass accumulation and soil CO2 efflux of mature Achnatherum hymenoides (a common and ecologically important C-3 bunchgrass growing throughout western North America) exposed to ambient or elevated temperature (+ 2 degrees C above ambient, warmed via infrared lamps) for 3 years. 3. The 2 degrees C increase in temperature caused a significant reduction in photosynthesis, plant growth and soil CO2 efflux. Of important note, photosynthesis and soil respiration appeared tightly coupled and the relationship between these fluxes was not altered by the elevated temperature treatment, suggesting C fixation's strong control of both above-ground and belowground dryland C cycling. Leaf water use efficiency was substantially increased in the elevated temperature treatment compared to the control treatment. 4. Taken together, our results suggest notable declines in photosynthesis with relatively subtle warming, reveal strong coupling between above-and below-ground C fluxes in this dryland and highlight temperature's strong effect on fundamental components of dryland C and water cycles.","[Wertin, Timothy M.; Belnap, Jayne; Reed, Sasha C.] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Moab, UT 84532 USA; [Wertin, Timothy M.] Univ Illinois, Carl R Woese Inst Genom Biol, 1206 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Wertin, TM (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Moab, UT 84532 USA.; Wertin, TM (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Carl R Woese Inst Genom Biol, 1206 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.","twertin@illinois.edu","Reed, Sasha C/ABE-9476-2020","Reed, Sasha C/0000-0002-8597-8619","U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research Terrestrial Ecosystem Sciences ProgramUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC-0008168]; U.S. Geological Survey Climate and Land Use Change and Ecosystems Mission Areas","We would like to thank Ed Grote for assistance with experimental design and set-up, Hilda Smith, Elizabeth Ogata, Kristina Young, Emily Harrison and Philip Adams for assistance with measurements.

While a lot is known about the relationships between genetic diversity, fitness, and current population size, very few studies explored the effects of past population size. Knowledge of past population size may, however, improve our ability to predict future population fates. We studied Gentianella praecox subsp. bohemica, a biennial species with extensive seed bank. We tested the effect of current, past minimal and maximal population size, and harmonic mean of population sizes within the last 15 years on genetic diversity and fitness. Maximum population size over the last 15 years was the best predictor of expected heterozygosity of the populations and was significantly related to current population size and management. Plant fitness was significantly related to current as well as maximum population size and expected heterozygosity. The results suggested that information on past population size may improve our understanding of contemporary genetic diversity across populations. They demonstrated that despite the strong fluctuations in population size, large reductions in population size do not result in immediate loss of genetic diversity and reduction of fitness within the populations. This is likely due to the seed bank of the species serving as reservoir of the genetic diversity of the populations. From a conservation point of view, this suggests that the restoration of small populations of short-lived species with permanent seed bank is possible as these populations may still be genetically diverse.","[Munzbergova, Zuzana; Surinova, Maria; Husakova, Iveta] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, Prague 12801 2, Czech Republic; [Munzbergova, Zuzana; Surinova, Maria; Husakova, Iveta] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic; [Brabec, Jiri] Muzeum Cheb, Krale Jiriho Podebrad 493-4, Cheb 35011, Czech Republic","Munzbergova, Z (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, Prague 12801 2, Czech Republic.; Munzbergova, Z (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic.","zuzmun@natur.cuni.cz","Surinova, Maria/F-5239-2015; Munzbergova, Zuzana/F-6321-2013; Husakova, Iveta/W-1324-2017","Munzbergova, Zuzana/0000-0002-4026-6220; Husakova, Iveta/0000-0002-4778-1874","Agency of nature and landscape protection of the Czech Republic (AOPK); European Economic Area (EEA) funds; Ministry of the Environment of the Czech Republic","We thank Population Ecology Department (POP-EKOL) discussion group and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on the manuscript.

The presence of source patches, however, may facilitate persistence of species-supersaturation in the face of invaders. We explore that notion here through simulation analyses of more detailed spatially explicit models depicting one- and two-dimensional systems (pipe and two-eddy models, respectively) where water circulation is governed over a range of advection and turbulent diffusion. For the pipe model, when advection and turbulent diffusion are low, and when advection is high and turbulent diffusion is low, resident assemblages are more resistant to invaders. But at intermediate rates of advection and with increases to turbulent diffusion, assemblages are more quickly impacted by invaders. For the two-eddy model, when advection and turbulent diffusion are low, resident assemblages are again resistant to invaders, but only for lumpy assemblages. In contrast to the pipe model, resistance to invaders of neutral and lumpy assemblages is high when advection and turbulent diffusion are high. For both model configurations, intransitive assemblages were much more sensitive to invaders, suggesting that intransitivity might not be as prevalent a biodiversity-sustaining mechanism in spatially heterogeneous plankton systems.

Although many studies have reported a substantial fitness cost associated with reproductive interference, suggesting its ecological significance, others have not observed reproductive interference in study species. Reproductive interference that incurs a large fitness cost is more likely to occur during secondary contacts than between long-coexisting species. I first explain the rationale underlying this prediction using existing literature. Next, I present a conceptual framework to classify pairs of interacting species into one of four states, defined by the ecological and evolutionary stabilities of the species pairs. I discuss how the stability states of species pairs are likely to change over time, along with changes in the demographic and evolutionary role of reproductive interference. I then perform literature survey to test the prediction that reproductive interference should be more prevalent in secondary contact.

Warming significantly increased necromass decomposition rates but was strongest in normally submerged microsites where warming caused water table drawdown. Necromass chemistry exerted the strongest control on the decomposition, with initial nitrogen content strongly predicting early decay rates (3 months) and initial melanin content determining mass remaining after 2 years.

After testing model predictions against field observations, we updated the model to generate projections of future coral communities. Our results indicated that communities distributed across an island landscape followed different recovery trajectories but would reassemble to pre-disturbed levels of coral abundance, composition, and size, thus demonstrating persistence in the provision of reef habitat and other ecosystem services. Our study indicates that coral community dynamics are predictable when accounting for the interplay between species life-history, environmental conditions, and density-dependence.

Bumble bees, syrphid flies, and non-syrphid flies were the predominant flower visitors. Foraging activity of bumble bees increased toward the late flowering period reflecting the life cycle of colony development. The activity of syrphid flies was sensitive to ambient temperature, while that of non-syrphid flies remained high throughout the season. Flower production of bee-pollinated plants fluctuated significantly between years with a bimodal pattern peaking in the early and late periods, while flower production of fly-pollinated plants was less variable between years. Fruit-set success of bee-pollinated plants increased considerably from the early to the late flowering period, while the trend for fly-pollinated plants was less marked. Three times more visits of dipteran insects are necessary for fly-pollinated plants to achieve fruiting success comparable to bee-pollinated plants. Bumble bees are potentially excellent pollinators, but the visitation frequency is low early in the season. Lower pollination ability of dipteran insects may be compensated for by abundant flower visits. The relationships between flowering phenology and fruit-set success of alpine plant communities highly depend on the type of pollinators.","[Mizunaga, Yuki; Kudo, Gaku] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan","Mizunaga, Y (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Fac Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.","mizunaga@ees.hokudai.ac.jp","Kudo, Gaku/A-2733-2015","Kudo, Gaku/0000-0002-6488-818X","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [23405006, 15H02641, 17K07551]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15H02641, 17K07551] Funding Source: KAKEN","We are grateful to Y.

Nearshore pelagic conditions often help to explain such variation, but most such studies have been done on eastern ocean boundary coasts. We investigated possible benthic-pelagic coupling along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, a western ocean boundary coast. In 2014, we surveyed high-intertidal habitats from nine wave-exposed bedrock locations spanning 415 km of coastline. At each location in the spring, we measured the recruitment of barnacles and mussels, the two main filter-feeders. Recruitment varied irregularly along the coast. Satellite data on coastal phytoplankton and particulate organic carbon (food for intertidal filter-feeders and their pelagic larvae) and in-situ data on sea surface temperature explained, to varying degrees, the geographic structure of recruitment. In turn, the summer abundance of barnacles and mussels was positively related to their spring recruitment. Ultimately, intertidal predator (dogwhelk) abundance was positively related to the recruitment and/or abundance of barnacles and mussels (the main prey of dogwhelks). Sea ice may also have influenced this predator-prey interaction. Drift ice leaving the Gulf of St. Lawrence in late winter strongly disturbed the northern surveyed locations, making barnacles (through high spring recruitment) the only food source for dogwhelks (which survived ice scour in crevices) in such places. Overall, this study supports the occurrence of benthic-pelagic coupling and bottom-up forcing on this coast. Investigating the oceanographic drivers of pelagic food supply and seawater temperature should help to further understand how this large metacommunity is organized.","[Scrosati, Ricardo A.; Ellrich, Julius A.] St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada","Scrosati, RA (corresponding author), St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada.","rscrosat@stfx.ca","Scrosati, Ricardo A/K-6172-2016","Scrosati, Ricardo A/0000-0002-3050-132X","Canada Research Chairs program (CRC)Canada Research ChairsAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme [210283]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [311624]; Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI Leaders Opportunity Grant) [202034]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) [91617093]","We appreciate the constructive comments from two anonymous reviewers and the field and laboratory assistance provided by Willy Petzold and Melanie Spieker.

The variable responses of ectotherms to habitat conversion, where some species decline while others persist, can partly be explained by variation among species in their thermal niches. However, few studies have examined thermal niche variation within species and across forest-land use ecotones, information that could provide clues about the capacity of species to adapt to changing temperatures. Here, we quantify individual-level variation in thermal traits of the tropical poison frog, Oophaga pumilio, in thermally contrasting habitats. Specifically, we examined local environmental temperatures, field body temperatures (T-b), preferred body temperatures (T-pref), critical thermal maxima (CTmax), and thermal safety margins (TSM) of individuals from warm, converted habitats and cool forests. We found that frogs from converted habitats exhibited greater mean T-b and T-pref than those from forests. In contrast, CTmax and TSM did not differ significantly between habitats. However, CTmax did increase moderately with increasing T-b, suggesting that changes in CTmax may be driven by microscale temperature exposure within habitats rather than by mean habitat conditions. Although O. pumilio exhibited moderate divergence in T-pref, CTmax appears to be less labile between habitats, possibly due to the ability of frogs in converted habitats to maintain their T-b below air temperatures that reach or exceed CTmax. Selective pressures on thermal tolerances may increase, however, with the loss of buffering microhabitats and increased frequency of extreme temperatures expected under future habitat degradation and climate warming. in Spanish is available with online material.","[Rivera-Ordonez, Juana M.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Nowakowski, A.

Classic theory predicts that convex trade-offs facilitate coexistence of specialized species with extreme trait values (extreme species) while concave trade-offs promote species with intermediate trait values (intermediate species). We show here that this prediction becomes insufficient when the traits translate non-linearly into fitness which frequently occurs in nature, e.g., an increasing length of spines reduces grazing losses only up to a certain threshold resulting in a saturating or sigmoid trait-fitness function. We present a novel, general approach to evaluate the effect of different trade-off shapes on species coexistence. We compare the trade-off curve to the invasion boundary of an intermediate species invading the two extreme species. At this boundary, the invasion fitness is zero. Thus, it separates trait combinations where invasion is or is not possible. The invasion boundary is calculated based on measurable trait-fitness relationships. If at least one of these relationships is not linear, the invasion boundary becomes non-linear, implying that convex and concave trade-offs not necessarily lead to different coexistence patterns. Therefore, we suggest a new ecological classification of trade-offs into extreme-favoring and intermediate-favoring which differs from a purely mathematical description of their shape. We apply our approach to a well-established model of an empirical predator-prey system with competing prey types facing a trade-off between edibility and half-saturation constant for nutrient uptake. We show that the survival of the intermediate prey depends on the convexity of the trade-off. Overall, our approach provides a general tool to make a priori predictions on the outcome of competition among species facing a common trade-off in dependence of the shape of the trade-off and the shape of the trait-fitness relationships.","[Ehrlich, Elias; Gaedke, Ursula] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Modelling, Neuen Palais 10, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Becks, Lutz] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Biol, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Community Dynam Grp, August Thienemann Str 2, D-24306 Plon, Germany","Ehrlich, E (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Modelling, Neuen Palais 10, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.","eehrlich@uni-potsdam.de",NA,NA,"German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [GA 401/25-1]; DFG's Emmy Noether Programme [BE 4135/3-1]","We are grateful to Christian Guill for helpful recommendations on the mathematical analysis.

However, trait elaboration in birds is not gender-restricted: female song has recently been revealed as a taxonomically-widespread trait within the songbirds (oscine Passerines), prompting increased research into likely functions and social/ecological correlates. Here we use phylogenetically-informed comparative analysis to test for an evolutionary association between female song and plumage color elaboration in songbirds. If there is an evolutionary trade-off between signaling modes, we predict a negative correlation between acoustic and visual elaboration. This trade-off hypothesis has been commonly proposed in males but has mixed empirical support. Alternatively, if song and plumage have similar or overlapping functions and evolve under similar selection pressures, we predict a positive correlation between female song and female plumage elaboration. We use published data on female song for 1023 species of songbirds and a novel approach that allows for the reliable and objective comparison of color elaboration between species and genders. Our results reveal a significant positive correlation between female colorfulness and female song presence. In species where females sing, females (but not males) are on average more colorful with concomitantly reduced average sexual dichromatism. These results suggest that female plumage and female song likely evolved together under similar selection pressures and that their respective functions are reinforcing. We discuss the potential roles of sexual vs. social selection in driving this relationship, and the implications for future research on female signals.","[Webb, Wesley H.; Brunton, Dianne H.; Aguirre, J.

The Ponto-Caspian species were recorded in the Volga River downstream of the city of Kazan (south of 55 degrees 32 ' N) and in the Kama River from the mouth to the upper reaches of the Kama Reservoir (59 degrees 20 ' N). Six alien species (Heterocope caspia, Calanipeda aquaedulcis, Eurytemora caspica, Cornigerius maeoticus maeoticus, Cercopagis pengoi, and Podonevadne trigona ovum) were recorded in the Volga reservoirs and three species (Heterocope caspia, Eurytemora caspica, and Cercopagis pengoi) were recorded in the Kama reservoirs. It was found first time that copepods Heterocope caspia and Eurytemora caspica spread and naturalized in the areas of all three Kama reservoirs (within the distance of 1000 km from the Volga River); the cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi formed a disrupted range with a group of habitats in the mouth part of the Kama River (55 degrees 12 '-55 degrees 26 ' N) and north near the city of Perm (57 degrees 53 '-58 degrees 26 ' N). The boundary of the ranges of Calanipeda aquaedulcis, Cornigerius maeoticus, and Cercopagis pengoi shifted 300-400 km to the north in the Volga River and 300 km in the Kama River; they occupied almost all area of the Kuibyshev Reservoir except for the upper reaches of its Volga part. The range expansion of the cladoceran Podonevadne trigona ovum was not observed; this species was found only in the Volgograd Reservoir (46 degrees 18 ' N). It was revealed that by 2017 the Mediterranean copepod Calanipeda aquaedulcis had become common (occurrence in more than 90% of samples), locally numerous in the Volga River from the city of Astrakhan (52 degrees N) to the mouth of the Kama River (55 degrees 12 ' N) and in the Kama River from the mouth to the upper reaches of the Kama part of the Kuibyshev Reservoir (55 degrees 24 ' N). It is revealed that a new species Eurytemora caspica (described in 2013), but not E. affinis (as it was believed earlier), lives in the Volga and Kama rivers.

Models of how these complementary resources are allocated between partners often assume optimal behavior, but whether mechanisms enabling global control exist in syntrophic systems, and what form they might take, is unknown. Recognizing that growth of plant organs that supply complementary resources, like roots and shoots, can occur autonomously, we present a theory of plant growth in which root-shoot allocation is determined by purely local rules. Each organ uses as much as it can of its locally produced or acquired resource (inorganic nitrogen or photosynthate) and shares only the surplus. Subject to stoichiometric conditions that likely hold for most plants, purely local rules produce the same optimal allocation as would global control across a wide range of environmental scenarios, with sharing the surplus being the specific mechanism stabilizing syntrophic dynamics. Our local control model contributes a novel approach to plant growth modeling because it assumes a simple mechanism of root:shoot allocation that can be considered a higher-level physiological rule, from which the optimal growth outcome emerges from the system's dynamics, rather than being built into the model. Moreover, our model is general, in that the mechanism of sharing the surplus can readily be adapted to many obligate syntrophic relationships.","[Ledder, Glenn] Univ Nebraska, Dept Math, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Russo, Sabrina E.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE USA; [Russo, Sabrina E.] Univ Nebraska, Ctr Plant Sci Innovat, Lincoln, NE USA; [Muller, Erik B.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Trondheim, Norway; [Muller, Erik B.; Nisbet, Roger M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Peace, Angela] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Nisbet, Roger M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Ledder, G (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Math, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.","gledder@unl.edu",NA,"Peace, Angela/0000-0001-8200-8839; Muller, Erik/0000-0003-2300-0727; Ledder, Glenn/0000-0003-2649-550X","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1300426]; The University of Tennessee, Knoxville; University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL)","This work was developed during working group meetings at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS) (DEB Model for Trees) sponsored by the National Science Foundation through NSF Award #DBI-1300426, with additional support from The University of Tennessee, Knoxville and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL).

In the opinion of the authors, the main reason for the environmental change is anthropogenic, specifically, the destruction of the forest cover, which causes a decrease in groundwater levels and subsequent desertification. From the perspective of the results obtained for the Tarim Basin landscapes, the research presumes that the anthropogenic factor was determinant in the desertification of its area. The natural features of the basin and its surroundings (high-elevation mountainous terrain, glaciers as a water source, active volcanoes, fertile foothill plains, mineral resources, and climate) and the economic advantages of geographic location at a trade crossroads predetermined the emergence of large focal point for the formation of Asian ethnoses in this area; this led to a major anthropogenic impact on the basin ecosystems, which ultimately resulted in landscape degradation and the emergence of deserts (Taklamakan Desert). The desertification processes were augmented by specific relief features, i.e., the rather significant differences in elevation between the basin margins and floor, its endorheic nature, natural disasters associated with volcanic eruptions and melting of glaciers, and the insignificant amount of precipitation. Russian researchers believe that, in the distant past, there was an occasional eruption of people relocating from large focal points of the development of early civilizations to other territories due to the large population size, human energy, and social problems (Gumbatov, 2018). The exodus of the tribes from a scanty hollow of the Tarim Basin towards the Mongol Steppe could have been one of the manifestations of those eruptions. This can be further supported by the origin of a sacral image of Odugen in the area of the modern-day volcanism in the Eastern Sayan and Khangai Mountains, which appears to have been preserved since the distant past and to be related to the deification of the active volcanoes in the Kunlun Range skirting the Tarim Basin. Another wave of migration from the desertified Tarim Basin was apparently directed toward the Indus Valley, where, in symbiosis with the indigenous population, it gave rise to the Vedic Period. The severe anthropogenic impact on the environment in the Indus Valley and adjoining areas played a part in the formation of new desert landscapes (Thar Desert). The proposed material can be, to some extent, considered a working hypothesis.","[Prudnikova, T.

The differences in the structure of undisturbed communities in different subzones are quite clear. These differences hard to distinguish on deposits and pastures. Having studied the vegetation cover of the steppe zone for many years, we set a task in 2018 and 2019 to identify the way in which the formation diversity changes on deposits and the extent to which the deposit structure can be used to assess the subzonal status of the territory.

Currently, a 30 m depth limit, based on SCUBA regulations, separates shallow and deep mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs). This definition, however, fails to explicitly accommodate environmental variation. Here, we posit a novel definition for a regional or reef-to-reef outlook of MCEs based on the light vs. coral community-structure relationship. A combination of physical and ecological methods enabled us to clarify the ambiguity in relation to the mesophotic definition. To characterize coral community structure with respect to the light environment, we conducted wide-scale spatial studies at five sites along shallow and MCEs of the Gulf of Eilat/Aqaba (0-100 m depth). Surveys were conducted by technical-diving and drop-cameras, in addition to one year of light spectral measurements. We quantify two distinct coral assemblages: shallow (<40 m) and MCEs (40-100 m), exhibiting markedly different relationships with light. The depth ranges and morphology of 47 coral genera were better explained by light than depth, mainly, due to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) (1% at 76 and 36 m, respectively). Branching coral species were found mainly at shallower depths, that is, down to 36 m. Among the abundant upper-mesophotic specialist corals, Leptoseris glabra, Euphyllia paradivisa, and Alveopora spp. were found strictly between 40 and 80 m depth. The only lower-mesophotic specialist, Leptoseris fragilis, was found deeper than 80 m. We suggest that shallow coral genera are light-limited below a level of 1.25% surface PAR and that the optimal PAR for mesophotic communities is at 7.5%. This study contributes to moving MCE ecology from a descriptive phase into identifying key ecological and physiological processes structuring MCE coral communities. Moreover, it may serve as a model enabling the description of a coral zonation worldwide on the basis of light quality data.","[Tamir, Raz; Kramer, Netanel; Loya, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Sch Zool, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Tamir, Raz] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci Eilat, Elat, Israel; [Eyal, Gal] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Eyal, Gal] Bar Ilan Univ, Mina & Everard Goodman Fac Life Sci, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Laverick, Jack H.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Tamir, R (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Sch Zool, Tel Aviv, Israel.; Tamir, R (corresponding author), Interuniv Inst Marine Sci Eilat, Elat, Israel.","raztamir6@gmail.com","Loya, Yossi/J-3039-2012; Loya, Joseph/AAJ-9014-2020; Kramer, Netanel/AAQ-5105-2021; Eyal, Gal/P-7884-2019","Loya, Yossi/0000-0001-6870-9444; Eyal, Gal/0000-0002-3028-8653; Kramer, Netanel/0000-0001-5150-0732; Laverick, Jack/0000-0001-8829-2084; Tamir, Raz/0000-0002-6988-2510","Israel Science Foundation (ISF) Grant [1191/16]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skodowska-Curie postdoctoral grant [796025]","We would like to thank the Interuniversity Institute for Marine Sciences at Eilat (IUI) for making their facilities available to us.

To overcome this, we present a topic modeling framework to analyze community composition in cross-disciplinary datasets, including those generated from metagenomics, metabolomics, field ecology and remote sensing. Using topic models, we demonstrate how community detection in different datasets can inform the conservation of interacting plants and herbivores. We show how topic models can identify members of molecular, organismal and landscape-level communities that relate to wildlife health, from gut microbes to forage quality.

We explore whether mid-Holocene African savannas were dominated by herbivory as a means of cycling nutrients, and whether fire perhaps played a lesser role than today. Evidence from savanna ecology, paleoecology, and historical literature indicates higher herbivore densities in mid-Holocene and pre-colonial times compared to present. While fire may increase or decrease forage availability for herbivores, depending on the nutrient status of the environment, herbivory tends to decrease fire intensity and frequency by decreasing fuel loads. Given this competitive relationship between fire and herbivory and the higher herbivore densities of the past, we suggest that some fire-dominated present-day savannas are the product of anthropogenic alterations in herbivore and fire regimes, including the increasing use of fire as a tool for managing ecosystems. We discuss whether managing for an alternative stable state dominated by herbivory could stimulate ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and production, and whether this will achieve the same management objectives traditionally satisfied by fire. Management implications may include the adaptive manipulation of herbivore densities over time and space to maintain an appropriate carrying capacity for the rainfall and soil nutrient status of the area, occasional use of fire, and including a diversity of herbivore functional guilds.","[Venter, Zander S.; Hawkins, Heidi-Jayne; Cramer, Michael D.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Hawkins, Heidi-Jayne] Conservat South Africa, Heritage House,Suite 301,20 Dreyer St, ZA-7735 Claremont, South Africa","Venter, ZS (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.","zander.v@hotmail.com","Hawkins, Heidi-Jayne/ABD-8790-2020","Hawkins, Heidi-Jayne/0000-0001-9334-0669; Venter, Zander/0000-0003-2638-7162","GreenMatter; Oppenheimer Memorial Trust","We thank the two reviewers on this manuscript for their valuable input.

We used stable isotope analysis to characterise foraging niches and to investigate the causes and consequences of individual niche variation in the European badger, a mustelid mammal that lives in territorial social groups, but forages alone. We found that the degree of individual niche variation within social groups was negatively related to the availability of farmland habitats, which represent an important foraging habitat for badgers; and was positively related to territory size, supporting the idea that resource limitation and ecological opportunity lead to increased individual specialisation. We also found that the degree of individual specialisation related to an individual's body condition and that this effect varied with ecological context; such that specialisation had a stronger positive relationship with body condition in social groups with reduced availability of key farmland habitats. Body condition was also related to the utilisation of specific resources (woodland invertebrates), but again this relationship varied with the availability of farmland foraging habitats. This study supports the idea that resource availability plays an important role in determining patterns of individual niche variation, and identifies the potential adaptive consequences of specialised foraging strategies.","[Robertson, Andrew; Bearhop, Stuart] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England; [Robertson, Andrew; Delahay, Richard J.] Anim & Plant Hlth Agcy, Natl Wildlife Management Ctr, Woodchester Pk GL10 3UJ, Glos, England; [Robertson, Andrew; McDonald, Robbie A.] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England; [Kelly, Simon D.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Kelly, Simon D.] Food & Environm Res Agcy, York YO41 1LZ, N Yorkshire, England","Bearhop, S (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England.","a.robertson@exeter.ac.uk; s.bearhop@exeter.ac.uk","McDonald, Robbie A/A-2931-2012; Bearhop, Stuart/G-3105-2012; Robertson, Andrew/A-4944-2016; McDonald, Robbie/AAK-2718-2020; Delahay, Richard/J-2261-2014","McDonald, Robbie A/0000-0002-6922-3195; Bearhop, Stuart/0000-0002-5864-0129; Robertson, Andrew/0000-0003-3720-6670; McDonald, Robbie/0000-0002-6922-3195;","European Social Fund (ESF)European Social Fund (ESF); UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural AffairsDepartment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA); EUEuropean Commission [STATEMIG 310820]","We thank the National Wildlife Management Centre's Woodchester Park field team for carrying out the trapping and sampling of badgers to obtain whiskers for the purposes of this study.

Species interactions, such as those between plants and pollinators, are known to be shaped by both evolutionary history and ecological factors. However, little is known about how multiple factors (e.g. phylogeny, phenology, abundance and functional traits) interactively affect interaction patterns. 2. Using a plant-bumblebee network comprising 2,428 interactions between 29 plant species and 12 bumblebee species in the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains, we tested for phylogenetic signal and whether phylogenetic pattern was explained by abundance, phenology and 13 plant and bumblebee functional traits. We also tested whether trait matching in two pairs of plant-bumblebee traits explained interaction frequencies at both species and individual levels. 3. The network showed significant phylogenetic signal; closely related bumblebees tended to visit similar sets of plants, but not vice versa. Among all the measured factors, nectar volume and sugar concentration, rather than other phylogenetically constrained factors, were most important for explaining phylogenetic pattern (64% and 54% respectively). Although long-tongued bumblebee species tended to interact with long-tubed flowers, trait matching did not predict short-tongued bee interaction frequencies. Despite this, trait matching was apparent at the level of individual bees, reflecting intraspecific variation in tongue length and body size. Different selection pressures may exist within this bumblebee community, resulting in specialized, co-evolved traits in long-tongued species and adaptive generalization in short-tongued species to gain access to a variety of flowers. 4. Together, these findings contribute to our understanding of phylogenetic trait-based structure in species interaction networks. In particular, this study provides new evidence for the importance of nectar rewards in structuring interaction patterns in pollination mutualisms. The results also demonstrate that trait matching may occur at the individual level, despite not being detectable at the species level, and underline the necessity of taking intraspecific trait variation into account in studies of community structure.","[Liang, Huan; Zhao, Yan-Hui; Ren, Zong-Xin; Zhong, Li; Wang, Hong] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Plant Divers & Biogeog East Asia, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Rafferty, Nicole E.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Rafferty, Nicole E.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; [Li, Hai-Dong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, De-Zhu] Chinese Acad Sci, Plant Germplasm & Genom Ctr, Kunming Inst Bot, Germplasm Bank Wild Species, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Wang, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Plant Divers & Biogeog East Asia, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.; Rafferty, NE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.; Rafferty, NE (corresponding author), Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA.","nicole.rafferty@ucr.edu; wanghong@mail.kib.ac.cn","Rafferty, Nicole/F-1812-2013; Li, De-Zhu/G-8203-2011","Rafferty, Nicole/0000-0002-6350-1705; Li, De-Zhu/0000-0002-4990-724X","Yunling Scholarship of Yunnan Provincial Government [YLXL20170001]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [201804910805]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB31000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province [U1502261]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U1502261, 31700361, 32071670]","the Yunling Scholarship of Yunnan Provincial Government, Grant/Award Number: YLXL20170001; the China Scholarship Council, Grant/Award Number: 201804910805; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: XDB31000000; the Joint Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China--Yunnan Province, Grant/Award Number: U1502261; the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31700361 and 32071670",NA,76,0,0,4,4,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0269-8463","1365-2435",NA,"FUNCT ECOL","Funct.

Decomposition of litter is a key biochemical process that regulates the rate and magnitude of CO2 fluxes from biosphere to atmosphere and determines soil nutrient availability. Although several studies have shown that plant litter decomposition accelerated in their native compared to a foreign environment, that is, a home-field advantage (HFA) for litter degradation, to date HFA has only been considered in terms of respiration or litter mass loss. 2. The competitive success of the decomposer micro-organism will be determined by its ability to transform used OM into population growth. Therefore, we hypothesized that HFA for microbial growth would be more pronounced than that for decomposition. We also expected that HFA effect for decomposition and microbial growth would increase with lower quality litter, which the fungal role in litter decomposition would be more dominant than that of bacteria, and that HFA effects would strengthen with more pronounced differences between 'home' and 'away' environments. 3. We designed a 2-month microcosm reciprocal transplant experiment with litter from two sites with contrasting climates (Atlantic and Sub-Mediterranean climates) and including three tree species (Quercus robur, Pinus sylvestris and Fagus sylvatica). 4. We found a stronger HFA for microbial growth than for decomposition, that the nutrient content and C-quality of litter influenced the microbial HFA and that interactions between bacterial and fungal communities during litter decomposition modulated the HFA for litter degradation. 5. Low litter nutrient content, strong nutrient limitations and low C-qualities all favoured fungal over bacterial decomposers, and our results suggest a dominant functional role of the fungal community and gave rise to HFA effect for fungal growth but that this translated to only marginal implications for overall decomposition of litter.","[Benito-Carnero, Garazi; Gartzia-Bengoetxea, Nahia; Arias-Gonzalez, Ander] NEIKER Basque Inst Agr Res & Dev, Dept Forest Sci, Zamudio, Spain; [Rousk, Johannes] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Microbial Ecol, MEMEG, Lund, Sweden","Benito-Carnero, G (corresponding author), NEIKER Basque Inst Agr Res & Dev, Dept Forest Sci, Zamudio, Spain.","garazi.benito@gmail.com","Rousk, Johannes/E-9741-2010","Rousk, Johannes/0000-0002-4985-7262","COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [FP1305]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [2015-04942, 2020-04083]; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [2018-01315]; Knut and Alice Wallenberg FoundationKnut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation [KAW 2017.0171]; INIAInstituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA) [FPI2014-040]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [RTA2012-00048-00-00]; Department of Economic Development and Infrastructure of the Basque Government","COST Action, Grant/Award Number: FP1305; Swedish Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 2015-04942 and 2020-04083; Swedish Research Council Formas, Grant/Award Number: 2018-01315; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, Grant/Award Number: KAW 2017.0171; INIA, Grant/Award Number: FPI2014-040; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Grant/Award Number: RTA2012-00048-00-00; Department of Economic Development and Infrastructure of the Basque Government",NA,61,0,0,39,39,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0269-8463","1365-2435",NA,"FUNCT ECOL","Funct.

Yet defining these relationships and how they vary across ecosystems and microbial lineages is key to incorporating microbial communities into ecological forecasts and ecosystem models. To define linkages between turnover of soil bacterial and fungal communities and their function we sampled fungal and bacterial composition, abundance, and enzyme activities across a 3-ha area of wet tropical primary forest over 2 yr. We show that fungal and bacterial communities both exhibited temporal turnover, but turnover of both groups was much lower than in temperate ecosystems. Turnover over time was driven by gain and loss of microbial taxa and not changes in abundance of individual species present in multiple samples. Only fungi varied over space with idiosyncratic variation that did not increase linearly with distance among sampling locations. Only phosphorus-acquiring enzyme activities were linked to shifts in septate, decomposer fungal abundance; no enzymes were affected by composition or diversity of fungi or bacteria. Although temporal and spatial variation in composition was appreciable, because turnover of microbial communities did not alter the functional repertoire of decomposing enzymes, functional redundancy among taxa may be high in this ecosystem. Slow temporal turnover of tropical soil microbial communities and large functional redundancy suggests that shifts in abundance of particular functional groups may capture ecosystem function more accurately than composition in these heterogeneous ecosystems.","[Kivlin, Stephanie N.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Kivlin, Stephanie N.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Hawkes, Christine V.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Raleigh, NC 27965 USA","Kivlin, SN (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.; Kivlin, SN (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.","skivlin@utk.edu",NA,"Hawkes, Christine/0000-0002-1043-9469","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1119169]","The authors thank R.

However, research is often limited to the dichotomous analysis of shaded agroforestry systems or unshaded monocultures, often overlooking the nuanced effect of shade tree trait diversity. Our study aims to determine the cumulative effects of shade tree canopy architectural characteristics and leaf functional traits in biodiverse agroforests on microclimate modifications and CLR incidence. We measured plot-level microclimate conditions (air temperature, relative humidity, leaf wetness duration, throughfall kinetic energy) in three single-stratum and two double-strata shade tree canopy treatments, including Erythrina poeppigiana, Terminalia amazonia, and Chloroleucon eurycyclum. Commonly reported canopy characteristics and leaf traits were compared to average microclimate conditions and CLR incidence levels. We found that shade tree trait expression significantly explained most microclimate conditions, and that two key shade tree traits (canopy openness, leaf area) significantly explain CLR incidence levels (R-2 = 0.211, p = 0.036). Our results highlight the differences in microclimate conditions and CLR incidence among biodiverse agroforests, as well as the important explanatory power of shade tree traits. Specific effects of shade tree traits on pathogen dynamics can directly inform agroforestry system design (i.e., shade tree species selection) and sustainable coffee farm management practices (i.e., pruning practices).","[Gagliardi, Stephanie; Isaac, Marney E.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, 1265 Mil Trail, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Avelino, Jacques] UMR PHIM, CIRAD, Turrialba, Costa Rica; [Avelino, Jacques] Univ Montpellier, PHIM Plant Hlth Inst, Inst Agro, CIRAD,INRAE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Avelino, Jacques; Virginio Filho, Elias de Melo] Ctr Agron Trop Invest & Ensenanza CATIE, Turrialba, Costa Rica","Isaac, ME (corresponding author), Univ Toronto Scarborough, 1265 Mil Trail, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada.","marney.isaac@utoronto.ca","Avelino, Jacques/C-5624-2009","Avelino, Jacques/0000-0003-1983-9431; Gagliardi, Stephanie/0000-0003-1612-0173","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada",NA,58,1,1,2,2,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0006-3606","1744-7429",NA,"BIOTROPICA","Biotropica","SEP",2021,"53","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1356","1367",NA,"10.1111/btp.12984",NA,"JUN 2021",12,"Ecology","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","UQ9NE","WOS:000667303600001",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-09-23",NA

In Lake Michigan, offshore oligotrophication has occurred since the 1970s, owing to reductions in total phosphorus (TP) inputs and nearshore sequestration of TP by nonindigenous dreissenid mussels. We evaluated simultaneous effects of stock enhancement and oligotrophication on salmonine species (Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, and steelhead O. mykiss) that support valuable recreational fisheries. We employed a novel application of an Ecopath with Ecosim model by conducting a full factorial simulation experiment. Our design included multiple levels of salmonine stocking, consumption by invasive quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis), and TP that were informed by manager interests. Under all levels of TP and quagga mussel consumption, our results showed that stock enhancement could still increase salmonine biomass, but positive responses were stronger for lake trout and steelhead than Chinook salmon. Simulations showed that quagga mussel consumption has deleterious effects on pelagic-oriented prey fishes and Chinook salmon, which feed almost exclusively on the pelagic-oriented alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus). In summary, results from our simulation experiment suggested that lake trout and steelhead are better suited to the current ecosystem than Chinook salmon, and therefore, stock enhancement provides the highest gains for these two species. Furthermore, simulated biomass of all recreational salmonine species increased with increasing TP, indicating the need for managers to consider how potential future oligotrophication will limit the carrying capacity of salmonine biomass in Lake Michigan.","[Kao, Yu-Chun] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, 1405 South Harrison Rd, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA; [Rogers, Mark W.] Tennessee Technol Univ, Tennessee Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Box 5114, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA; [Bunnell, David B.] US Geol Survey, Great Lakes Sci Ctr, 1451 Green Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA","Kao, YC (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, 1405 South Harrison Rd, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA.","kaoyc@msu.edu","Kao, Yu-Chun/F-1564-2016","Kao, Yu-Chun/0000-0001-5552-909X",NA,NA,NA,66,10,10,0,31,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","1432-9840","1435-0629",NA,"ECOSYSTEMS","Ecosystems","JUN",2018,"21","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,"600","618",NA,"10.1007/s10021-017-0173-5",NA,NA,19,"Ecology","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","GH8YP","WOS:000433955800002",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-09-23",NA

Together with concurrent poleward shifts in many insect species this may increase herbivore pressure on plants. However, the manner in which plants at higher latitudes become colonized by herbivorous insects in the future is unknown. We established a translocation experiment using 26 micropropagated silver birch Betula pendula genotypes from six populations originating from 60 degrees N to 67 degrees N, to study the susceptibility of the translocated birches to local herbivores. The birches were planted at three different latitudes in Finland (60 degrees N, 62 degrees N and 67 degrees N). We studied the effect of source population and latitudinal translocation on herbivore density, species richness, and community composition among the genotypes growing in the same environmental conditions in two years; 2011 and 2012. The source population explained the variation in the herbivore density only in 2012, whereas latitudinal translocation did not affect herbivore density. Variation in species richness was not explained by the source population or by the latitudinal translocation. At two of the study sites, the similarity of the herbivore communities among the populations decreased with increasing latitudinal distance of the source populations, possibly because birch populations that grow geographically closer to each other are genetically more similar, and therefore support a more similar composition of the arthropod community. All birch genotypes were colonized by local herbivores, suggesting that as herbivores shift their ranges polewards, they are able to colonize novel host-plant genotypes. This enables compositional changes in insect communities on their host plants in the future, which in turn, might affect total herbivory and eventually, plant growth.","[Heimonen, Kaisa; Valtonen, Anu; Kontunen-Soppela, Sari; Keski-Saari, Sarita; Oksanen, Elina; Roininen, Heikki] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Biol, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland; [Rousi, Matti] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa Res Unit, FI-01301 Vantaa, Finland","Heimonen, K (corresponding author), Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Biol, POB 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland.","kaisa.heimonen@uef.fi",NA,"Kontunen-Soppela, Sari/0000-0003-3952-594X; Keski-Saari, Sarita/0000-0003-1967-7428; Oksanen, Elina/0000-0002-1866-736X","Univ of Eastern Finland [931060]; Joensuu University Foundation","This research was supported by the strategic funding of the Univ of Eastern Finland, project 931060, and by Joensuu University Foundation (to AV).",NA,53,14,14,2,49,"WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0030-1299","1600-0706",NA,"OIKOS","Oikos","AUG",2015,"124","8",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1013","1022",NA,"10.1111/oik.01986",NA,NA,10,"Ecology","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","CO3LJ","WOS:000359058600005",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-09-23",NA

Production of young shrimp from any given bay system, and hence commercial harvest of sub-adults and adults from the Gulf, is highly variable from year to year. We describe development of a spatially-explicit, individual-based model representing the cumulative effects of temperature, salinity, and access to emergent marsh vegetation on the growth and survival of young brown shrimp, and we use the model to simulate shrimp production from Galveston Bay, Texas, U.S.A. under environmental conditions representative of those observed from 1983 to 2012. Simulated mean annual (January through August) production ranged from 27.5 kg ha(-1) to 43.5 kg ha(-1) with an overall mean of 34.3 kg ha(-1) (0.70 kg ha(-1) SE). Sensitivity analyses included changing values of key model parameters by +/- 10% relative to baseline. Increasing growth rates 10% caused a 16% increase in production, whereas a 10% decrease resulted in an 18% decrease in production. A 10% increase in mortality probabilities resulted in a production decrease of 15% while a 10% decrease resulted in an 18% increase in production. We also changed values of environmental input data by 10%. Mean production estimates increased 11% in response to increasing tide heights (and thus, marsh habitat access) and decreased 19% with a decrease in tide height (and marsh access). The thirty year mean production was affected negatively by both the 10% increase and decrease in air temperature (-2% and -14%, respectively). Simulations in which bay water salinities were entirely low (0-10 PSU), intermediate (10-20 PSU), or high (>20 PSU) resulted in mean baseline production rates being reduced by 55, 7, and 0%, respectively. Uncertainty in model estimates of shrimp production were related to the magnitude and the timing of postlarval shrimp recruitment to the bay system. Simulations indicated that mean production decreased when recruitment occurred earlier in the year under all environmental conditions. Mean production varied with environmental conditions, however, when recruitment was delayed. The model reproduced biomass and size distribution patterns observed in field data. Although annual variability of modeled shrimp production did not correlate well (R-2 = 0.005) with fisheries independent trawl data from Galveston Bay, there was a significant correlation with similar trawl data collected in the northern Gulf of Mexico (R-2 = 0.40; p = 0.0005). Identifying and representing spatially variable factors such as predator distribution and abundance among bays, therefore, may be the key to understanding bay-specific contributions to the adult stock.

However, despite recent advances in our understanding of trophic cascades, evidence is often circumstantial on coral reefs because fishing pressure frequently co-varies with other anthropogenic effects, such as fishing for herbivorous fishes and changes in water quality due to pollution. Australia's outer Great Barrier Reef (GBR) has experienced fishing-induced declines of apex predators and mesopredators, but pollution and targeting of herbivorous fishes are minimal. Here, we quantify fish and benthic assemblages across a fishing-induced predator density gradient on the outer GBR, including apex predators and mesopredators to herbivores and benthic assemblages, to test for evidence of trophic cascades and alternative hypotheses to trophic cascade theory. Using structural equation models, we found no cascading effects from apex predators to lower trophic levels: a loss of apex predators did not lead to higher levels of mesopredators, and this did not suppress mobile herbivores and drive algal proliferation. Likewise, we found no effects of mesopredators on lower trophic levels: a decline of mesopredators was not associated with higher abundances of algae-farming damselfishes and algae-dominated reefs. These findings indicate that top-down forces on coral reefs are weak, at least on the outer GBR. We conclude that predator-mediated trophic cascades are probably the exception rather than the rule in complex ecosystems such as the outer GBR.","[Casey, Jordan M.; Baird, Andrew H.; Hoogenboom, Mia O.; Rizzari, Justin R.; Frisch, Ashley J.; Connolly, Sean R.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Australian Res Council, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Brandl, Simon J.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Tennenbaum Marine Observ Network, 647 Contees Wharf Rd, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Hoogenboom, Mia O.; Rizzari, Justin R.; Mirbach, Christopher E.; Connolly, Sean R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Frisch, Ashley J.] Reef HQ, Great Barrier Reef Marine Pk Author, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia","Casey, JM (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Australian Res Council, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.","jcasey508@gmail.com","Hoogenboom, Mia O/D-3664-2012; Baird, Andrew Hamilton/C-8449-2009; Brandl, Simon/H-4150-2019; Connolly, Sean/E-7773-2011","Hoogenboom, Mia O/0000-0003-3709-6344; Baird, Andrew Hamilton/0000-0001-8504-4077; Brandl, Simon/0000-0002-6649-2496; Connolly, Sean/0000-0003-1537-0859; Casey, Jordan/0000-0002-2434-7207","ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and James Cook UniversityAustralian Research Council","We thank O.

The rate of elongation and thickening of individual branches (shoots) varies across plant species. This variation is important for the outcome of competition and other plant-plant interactions. Here, we compared rates of shoot growth across 44 species from tropical, warm temperate and cool temperate forests of eastern Australia. 2. Shoot growth rate was found to correlate with a suite of traits including the potential height of the species, xylem-specific conductivity, leaf size, leaf area per xylem cross-section (LA/XA), twig diameter (at 40 cm length), wood density and modulus of elasticity. 3. Within this suite of traits, maximum plant height was the clearest correlate of growth rates, explaining 50%-67% of the variation in growth overall (p < .0001), and 23%-32% of the variation (p < .05) in growth when holding the influence of the other traits constant. Structural equation models suggest that traits associated with hydraulics, biomechanics and the  leaf economics spectrum represent three clearly separated axes of variation, with the hydraulic axis exhibiting the strongest alignment with height and largest independent contribution to growth (in the case of branch thickening). However, most of the capacity of these axes to predict growth was also associated with maximum height, presumably reflecting coordinated selection on multiple traits that together influence life histories. 4. Growth rates were not strongly correlated with leaf nitrogen or leaf mass per unit leaf area. 5. Correlations between growth and maximum height arose both across latitude (47%, p < .0001) and from within-site differences between species (30%, p < .0001). Covariation between growth and maximum height was driven in part by variation in irradiance across sites as well as among canopy positions within sites (23%, p < .0001). A significant fraction of this shared variation was independent of irradiance (45%, p < .0001), reflecting intrinsic differences across species and sites.","[Gleason, Sean M.; Stephens, Andrea E.

Drawing on a novel conceptual and analytic framework, we quantified rITV as the ratio of FD associated with between-population ITV (Intra_FD) and the interspecific variation (Inter_FD) due to species turnover across sites. We predicted that rITV would increase with environmental harshness as a result of decreasing interspecific variation and concomitant increases in between-population ITV. We empirically tested this prediction in a comparison of rITV for five traits (mature plant height, SLA, leaf dry matter content and the foliar concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus (P)) characterizing species in Tibetan alpine meadow communities from contrasting environmental regimes. We found that across sites: (a) rITV for all five traits increased with environmental harshness not only through decreasing Inter_FD but also through increasing Intra_FD; (b) increases in rITV were mostly attributable to declines in soil resources, especially soil P, with lower soil P significantly associated with lower Inter_FD but higher Intra_FD for most traits; and (c) although neither Intra_FD nor Inter_FD was significantly impacted by species richness for any traits, a higher rITV for SLA was significantly associated with low species richness. Taken together, these results support our hypothesis that the functional significance of ITV in plant communities increases with environmental harshness. Moreover, in the Tibetan alpine meadows we studied, the opposing intraspecific and interspecific responses along a gradient of P availability appear to act as a buffering mechanism stabilizing the functional structure of communities on P deficient soils. Our novel conceptual and analytical framework provides a template for evaluating the generality of this favourable mismatch between intraspecific and interspecific responses in FD along environmental gradients.

However, at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (New Hampshire, USA), recent stream NO3- concentrations have been unexpectedly low in mature watersheds. Poorly understood retention of NO3--N in soil organic matter (SOM) may explain this discrepancy. The relative availability of C and N in SOM influences NO3--N retention and may vary during succession due to processes of N mining and re-accumulation. To evaluate the strength of the SOM sink for NO3--N, we applied a (NO3-)-N-15 tracer to the mineral soil in eight stands spanning a forest chronosequence from about 20 years to old growth (>> 200 years). We tracked N-15 recovery in SOM fractions in the upper 10 cm of B horizon over 5 weeks. Overall, forest age did not directly control the 5-week recovery of N-15, but it had an indirect effect via its influence on SOM properties such as C/N. Old-growth forest soils had the lowest C/N, implying closer proximity to effective N saturation. Across sites, both the particulate- and mineral-associated SOM fractions rapidly incorporated N-15, but recovery in each fraction generally declined with time, reflecting the dynamic nature of SOM. These results indicate that mineral horizons can provide an important N sink through the short term in forests of all ages, but that SOM-N remains subject to active cycling and potential loss from the soil pool over the longer term.","[Fuss, Colin B.; Lovett, Gary M.] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; [Fuss, Colin B.; Goodale, Christine L.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA; [Ollinger, Scott V.; Ouimette, Andrew P.] Univ New Hampshire, Complex Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Lang, Ashley K.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Fuss, CB (corresponding author), Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA.; Fuss, CB (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA.","fussc@caryinstitute.org","Ollinger, Scott V/N-3380-2014","Ollinger, Scott V/0000-0001-6226-1431; Lang, Ashley/0000-0002-6080-1681; Goodale, Christine/0000-0003-4317-3983","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1257956, DEB 1633026, DEB 1637685]","We thank Nick Jakubek, Wade Simmons, Liza Tetley, Charlene Tarsa, and Mikayla Jacobs for assistance with field or laboratory work.

Measurements of Rs using chambers were conducted between June and November 2012 in a humid savannah in Western Kenya to determine how simulated rainfall amounts and cattle grazing affected soil respiration. The experimental layout was split plot comprising rainfall simulations which were laid on grazed and fenced blocks, respectively. The rainfall simulations split plots each measured 6 m x 3 m and were covered with rainout gutters above the canopy of the herbaceous layer to either increase or reduce ambient rainfall by 50%. Grazing increased soil bulk density and significantly (p < 0.05) lowered soil respiration rates and soil water content irrespective of the rainfall treatment. The positive correlation between Rs and root biomass in both grazed and fenced plots revealed a significant contribution of root growth activities to Rs. Increased soil water content (SWC) by rainfall addition improved water penetration into deeper soil layers and therefore stimulated root and microbial activities which in turn built up soil respiration. Reduction in SWC by rainfall exclusion lowered microbial contact with the organic substrate and likely caused death and/ or inactivity of roots.","[Ondier, Joseph; John, Onyango C.] Maseno Univ, Dept Bot, Private Bag Maseno, Kisumu, Kenya; [Ondier, Joseph; Otieno, Dennis O.] Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Bondo, Kenya; [Okach, Daniel O.; Otieno, Dennis O.] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Plant Ecol, Bayreuth, Germany","Ondier, J (corresponding author), Maseno Univ, Dept Bot, Private Bag Maseno, Kisumu, Kenya.","josephondier@yahoo.com",NA,"Ondier, Joseph/0000-0002-0858-574X",NA,NA,NA,54,3,3,2,21,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0141-6707","1365-2028",NA,"AFR J ECOL","Afr.

Research published in two previous Special Issues of The Rangeland Journal shows that recent climate change added to overgrazing and other factors caused increased degradation of Inner Mongolian rangelands whereas on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, climate change tended to ameliorate the impacts of overgrazing. Recent climate change on the Mongolian Plateau involved warming with increasingly variable annual precipitation and decreased summer rainfall. Future climate projections are different, involving modest increases in precipitation and further climate warming. Research published in the current Special Issue shows that precipitation is the climate factor that has the most substantial impact on ecosystem functions in this region and is positively correlated with plant species diversity, ecosystem carbon exchange and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. Increased flows of provisioning and regulating ecosystem services are expected with future climate change indicating that its impacts will be positive in this region. However, spatial heterogeneity in the environments and climates of Inner Mongolia highlights the risk of over-generalising from local-scale studies and indicates the value of increased attention to meta-analysis and regional scale models. The enhanced flows of ecosystem services from climate change may support sustainable development by promoting recovery of degraded grasslands with flow-on benefits for livelihoods and the regional economy. However, realising these potential benefits will depend on sound landscape management and addressing the risk of herders increasing livestock numbers to take advantage of the extra forage available. Investment in education is important to improve local capacity to adapt rangeland management to climate change, as are policies and strategies that integrate social, economic and ecological considerations and are tailored to specific regions. Gaps in understanding that could be addressed through further research on ecosystem functions include; belowground carbon exchange processes; the impact of increased variability in precipitation; and the impact of different management practices under changed climates.","[Hu, Guozheng; Gao, Qingzhu] CAAS, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Key Lab Agroenvironm & Climate Change, Minist Agr, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Davies, Jocelyn] Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Alice Springs, NT 0870, Australia; [Liang, Cunzhu] Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Life Sci, Hohhot 010021, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China","Gao, QZ (corresponding author), CAAS, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Key Lab Agroenvironm & Climate Change, Minist Agr, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.","gaoqingzhu@caas.cn","Davies, Jocelyn/D-7058-2011",NA,"National Key Project of Scientific and Technical Supporting Program of China [2013BAC09B03]; National Forage Industry Projects, China [CARS-35]; National Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China [2014ZD02]","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Key Project of Scientific and Technical Supporting Program of China (2013BAC09B03), National Forage Industry Projects, China (CARS-35), and The National Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China (2014ZD02).",NA,122,4,5,4,36,"CSIRO PUBLISHING","CLAYTON","UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA","1036-9872","1834-7541",NA,"RANGELAND J","Rangeland J.",NA,2018,"40","2",NA,NA,"SI",NA,"191","203",NA,"10.1071/RJ18041",NA,NA,13,"Ecology","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","GG1HC","WOS:000432437000013",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021-09-23",NA

These changes are partially credited with a recent increase in wildfire number and extent, as well as more extreme fire behavior. Fire and herbivory historically interacted, and research has shown that the interaction creates a unique mosaic of vegetation heterogeneity that each disturbance alone does not create. Because fire and grazing have largely been decoupled in modern times, the degree to which the interaction affects fuels and fire regimes has not yet been quantified. We evaluated effects of fire-only and pyric herbivory on rangeland fuels and fire behavior simulated using BehavePlus at four sites across the southern Great Plains. We predicted patches managed via pyric herbivory would maintain lower fuel loads, and less intense simulated fire behavior than fire alone. We found that time since fire was a significant predictor of fuel loads and simulated fire behavior characteristics at all sites. Fuel loads and simulated fire behavior characteristics (flame length and rate of spread) increased with increasing time since fire in all simulated weather scenarios. Pyric herbivory mediated fuel accumulation at all sites. Mean fuel loads in fire-only treatments exceeded 5000 kg/ha within 24 months, but pyric herbivory treatments remained below 5000 kg/ha for approximately 36 months. Simulated flame lengths in fire-only treatments were consistently higher (up to 3 9) than in pyric herbivory treatments. Similarly, fire spread rates were higher in fire-only than in pyric herbivory treatments in all simulated weather conditions. Although all sites had potential to burn in the most extreme weather conditions, pyric herbivory reduced fuel accumulations, flame lengths, and rates of spread across all weather patterns simulated. These reductions extended the amount of time standard wildland firefighting techniques remain effective. Therefore, incorporating pyric herbivory into fuel management practices, in areas of high herbaceous productivity, increases the effectiveness of fuel treatments.","[Starns, Heath D.; Fuhlendorf, Samuel D.; Elmore, R.

Most small shorebird species mature and breed as 'yearlings', but have lower reproductive success than adults. In some species, yearlings may defer northward migration and remain in non-breeding regions ('oversummering') until they reach 2 years of age. Some adults also oversummer. Oversummering would be favoured by natural selection if survival were as a result raised sufficiently to compensate for the missed breeding opportunity. Several thousand Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) spend the non-breeding period at Paracas, Peru, including individuals with long bills (likely from eastern Arctic breeding populations similar to 8000 km distant) and short bills (likely from western Arctic breeding populations, up to 11,000 km distant), with short-billed birds more likely to oversummer. We tested the prediction that oversummering birds have higher survival than migrants, and that the magnitude of this higher survival for oversummering birds is enough to compensate for their lost breeding season. Methods: We used a Multi-State Mark-Recapture model based on 5 years of encounter data (n = 1963 marked birds, and 3229 resightings) obtained year-round at Paracas, Peru, to estimate seasonal (i.e. breeding and non-breeding) survivorship for migrant and oversummering birds. We calculated the magnitude of the oversummering survival advantage required to compensate, for both yearlings and adults, based on published measures of annual survival and reproductive success. Using bill length as a proxy for migration distance, we investigated whether migratory survival is distance-dependent. Results: We estimate that 28% of yearlings and 19% of adults oversummer. Survival is higher for oversummering birds than for migrants, and the oversummering survival advantage is greater for adults (0.215) than for yearlings (0.140). The theoretical thresholds predicted by the size of the missed reproductive opportunity are 0.240 for adults and 0.134 for yearlings. Migratory survival decreases and the oversummering rate increases with migration distance, as assessed by culmen length. Conclusions: Our results support the life history hypothesis that oversummering raises survival enough to compensate for the loss of a breeding opportunity. Greater migration distance lowers survival and increases the probability of oversummering.","[Tavera, Eveling A.; Lank, David B.; Ydenberg, Ronald C.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Wildlife Ecol, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Tavera, Eveling A.] Ctr Ornitol & Biodiversidad CORBIDI, Santa Rita 105,Of 202, Lima 33, Peru; [Tavera, Eveling A.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Wildlife Ecol, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5C 2G2, Canada; [Stauffer, Glenn E.] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, 107 Sutliff Ave, Rhinelander, WI 54501 USA","Tavera, EA (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Wildlife Ecol, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.; Tavera, EA (corresponding author), Ctr Ornitol & Biodiversidad CORBIDI, Santa Rita 105,Of 202, Lima 33, Peru.","etaveraf@sfu.ca",NA,"Tavera Fernandez, Eveling/0000-0003-0058-6569","Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act Program (NMBCA)","Funding was provided primarily by the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act Program (NMBCA) administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

By expanding clonally, landscape-forming plants can colonize bare unmodified environments and stimulate vegetation-landform feedback interactions. Yet, to what degree these plants rely on clonal integration for overcoming physical stress during biogeomorphological succession remains unknown. Here, we investigated the importance of clonal integration and resource availability on the resilience of two European beach grasses (i.e. Elytrigia juncea and Ammophila arenaria) over a natural biogeomorphic dune gradient from beach (unmodified system) to foredune (biologically modified system). We found plant resilience, as measured by its ability to recover and expand following disturbance (i.e. plant clipping), to be independent on the presence of rhizomal connections between plant parts. Instead, resource availability over the gradient largely determined plant resilience. The pioneer species, Elytrigia, demonstrated a high resilience to physical stress, independent of its position on the biogeomorphic gradient (beach or embryonic dune). In contrast, the later successional species (Ammophila) proved to be highly resilient on the lower end of its distribution (embryonic dune), but it did not fully recover on the foredunes, most likely as a result of nutrient deprivation. We argue that in homogenously resource-poor environments as our beach system, overall resource availability, instead of translocation through a clonal network, determines the resilience of plant species. Hence, the formation of high coastal dunes may increase the resistance of beach grasses to the physical stresses of coastal flooding, but the reduced marine nutrient input may negatively affect the resilience of plants.","[Reijers, Valerie C.; Lammers, Carlijn; de Rond, Anne J.

In order to improve the modeling of the contaminant concentrations, it is proposed to first process the data using the Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method from HI-IT to obtain a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) which can then be modeled separately using either autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models expanded with a seasonal term, or linear regression analysis, depending on the nature of the IMF. Three priority contaminants measured at Niagara-on-the-Lakes are selected for this study. It is found that the trend of fluoranthene concentrations from April of 1986 to March of 1997 is decreasing and then beginning to increase; the 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene concentrations are decreasing; while the dieldrin concentrations are decreasing. With HHT, appropriate time series models can be identified and constructed for the studied contaminant concentrations to better illustrate the variability of each IMF (and thus the contaminant concentrations) for the studied period. For all data sets modeled in this study, pre-processing the data with HHT allowed for higher R-2 values, correlation coefficients and lower sum of squared errors when compared to modeling without HHT. It is thus confirmed that pre-processing the data with HHT and modeling with time series analysis will provide a more effective means of the studied data sets when identifying and analyzing the trends and variability of studied contaminant concentrations in the Niagara River.","[Tsai, Christina W.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan; [Treadwell, Huntington] SUNY Buffalo, Civil Struct & Environm Engn, 207 Jarvis Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Tsai, Christina W.] SUNY Buffalo, Civil Struct & Environm Engn, 223 Jarvis Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA","Tsai, CW (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.","cwstsai@ntu.edu.tw; hrt@buffalo.edu",NA,"Tsai, Christina/0000-0003-2309-6335","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-0748787]","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from National Science Foundation under grant contract number EAR-0748787.

Peripheral populations are often smaller and tend to occur under different and suboptimal conditions from those of core populations. Peripheral populations can also coexist during part of their annual cycle with populations from the core of the species' range. Studies on peripheral populations are thus valuable for broadly understanding ecological and evolutionary processes. The Two-banded Plover (TWBP, Charadrius falklandicus, Charadriidae) is an endemic South American shorebird that breeds in Argentine and Chilean Patagonia and migrates northward during the Austral winter. There are breeding records, however, from Lagoa do Peixe National Park in southern Brazil. In this study, we (i) mapped TWBP nests, (ii) characterised their reproductive biology and nesting habitats, (iii) colour-marked birds and evaluated their seasonal occurrence patterns and (iv) estimated the size of the Brazilian population by combining supervised habitat classification analyses and generalised additive models. We estimated that the Brazilian population has 55 (95% CI: 44.1-66.6) breeding pairs and found that the length of their breeding season was roughly 5 months, spanning the Austral spring and summer. The population's nesting habitat differed, and their apparent reproductive success was lower than that of core populations. Unlike more southerly populations, the results of our mark-resighting efforts demonstrate that the Brazilian population is sedentary. Taken together, these results indicate that the Brazilian TWBP population seems geographically isolated from the species' southernmost core populations, resulting in a heteropatric distribution. Furthermore, differences in nesting habitat and year-round residency indicate that this peripheral population is ecologically distinct. The marked behavioural and ecological differences combined with the small population at the northern edge of the TWBP distribution support the central-peripheral hypothesis in a Neotropical system.

However, the diversity of flowering phenologies and structures suggests that generalizations within the group are currently uninformative because few studies have addressed the role of multiple pollinator guilds, especially mammals. Aloe peglerae, endemic to montane grassland of the Magaliesberg Mountains, South Africa, is primarily bird pollinated, although small mammals are recorded nocturnal visitors. We compared the independent contributions of diurnal and nocturnal visitors, i.e. birds and small mammals respectively, to reproductive success by assigning 12 flowering A. peglerae plants to each of four pollinator selective exclusion treatments: (i) no-visitors; (ii) nocturnal-visitors; (iii) diurnal-visitors; and (iv) all-visitors (control). Birds alone contributed more to fruit set (1.2-2.6 times), average seed/fruit (1.0-1.8 times) and total seed production (1.1-2.8 times) than both the all visitors (birds and small mammals combined) and the small mammal visitors respectively. The exclusion of all visitors resulted in no fruit set, suggesting that A. peglerae requires pollinators to set seed. Germination trials over six weeks and viability testing with tetrazolium staining identified no significant differences among the three treatments that produced fruit and seed. Germination success was 90-97%, indicating that seed quality of small-mammal and bird-pollinated plants are similar. Aloe peglerae inflorescences were visited continuously throughout the day and night, with the Cape rock-thrush (Monticola rupestris) and dark-capped bulbul (Pycnonotus tricolor) being the most abundant pollinators, accounting for 68.2% and 13.7% of all visits respectively in the control treatment. Small mammals, i.e. Namaqua rock mouse (Micaelamys namaquensis) and eastern rock sengi (Elephantulus myurus), while not increasing reproductive success in the absence of birds, are suitable alternative pollinators. The presence of diurnal bird and nocturnal small mammal visitors provides a diversity of pollinators in this resilient pollination syndrome.","[Payne, Stephanie L.; Symes, Craig T.; Witkowski, Ed T.

We used a cellular automaton model to simulate population dynamics using the birth-death process to monitor the effect of space structure on the optimal sex ratio in EMS.The simulation showed that when the whole population was a panmixia, the optimal sex ratio would be 1:1 (male/female), which conforms to the Fisher's theory prediction. However, in a structured population, the ratio favoured a female-bias sexratio, which conforms to the local mate competition theory prediction. With the decreased dispersal range, the sex ratio strategy tended towards a higher male proportion, which is similar to the local resource competition prediction.The predictions of our model partly conformed to classical theories and explained some gaps in the ESS model. However, the driving force differed from the classical sex ratio model.The sex ratio was selected by population fitness rather than mother's fitness. The optimal sex ratio strategy for a population is to guarantee mating success, indicating that population survival may provide a complementary explanation for the sex ratio evolution.","[Wang, Xin; Zhao, Lan; Fang, Sheng-Guo] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Conservat Ctr Gene Resources Endangered Wil, MOE Key Lab Biosyst Homeostasis & Protect, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Wang, Rui-Wu] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Ctr Ecol & Environm Sci, Key Lab Space Biosci & Biotechnol, Xian 710072, Peoples R China","Fang, SG (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Conservat Ctr Gene Resources Endangered Wil, MOE Key Lab Biosyst Homeostasis & Protect, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China.; Wang, RW (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Ctr Ecol & Environm Sci, Key Lab Space Biosci & Biotechnol, Xian 710072, Peoples R China.","wangrw@nwpu.edu.cn; sgfanglab@zju.edu.cn",NA,NA,"Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31530087, 31230010]; National Key Program from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, [2016YFC0503200]; State Forestry Administration; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of ChinaFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31530087 and 31230010), the National Key Program (2016YFC0503200) from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, a special grant from the State Forestry Administration, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China.",NA,48,0,0,1,7,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0304-3800","1872-7026",NA,"ECOL MODEL","Ecol.

I tested the hypothesis that successional changes in vegetation structure, which affected invertebrate abundance, would influence growth rates and body condition in the early-successional, insectivorous gecko Nephrurus stellatus. I captured geckos at 17 woodland sites spanning a succession gradient from 2 to 48 years post-fire. Body condition and growth rates were analysed as a function of the best-fitting fire-related predictor (invertebrate abundance or time since fire) with different combinations of the co-variates age, sex and location. Body condition in the whole population was positively affected by increasing invertebrate abundance and, in the adult population, this effect was most pronounced for females. There was strong support for a decline in growth rates in weight with time since fire. The results suggest that increased early-successional invertebrate abundance has filtered through to a higher trophic level with physiological benefits for insectivorous geckos. I integrated the new findings about trophic interactions into a general conceptual model of mechanisms underlying post-fire population dynamics based on a long-term research programme. The model highlights how greater food availability during early succession could drive rapid population growth by contributing to previously reported enhanced reproduction and dispersal. This study provides a framework to understand links between ecological and physiological traits underlying post-fire population dynamics.","[Smith, Annabel L.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland","Smith, AL (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland.","annabel@smithecology.org","Smith, Annabel L./M-6391-2014","Smith, Annabel L./0000-0002-1201-8713","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP0776604]; Native Vegetation Council of South Australia; DEWNR; Wildlife Conservation Fund; Sir Mark Mitchell Research Foundation; Lirabenda Endowment Fund; Ecological Society of Australia; Australian National UniversityAustralian National University","This paper is dedicated to the memory of Professor C.

It is generally accepted that conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tends to underestimate the size of a tumor, which in turn can lead to a suboptimal treatment. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is an acceptable technique for studying the movements of water molecules of tissue. In diffusion-weighted imaging we may face with drastically different signals, depending on cell density and the type of tissue. Measuring the diffusion coefficient in brain tumors allows the classification of tumor types and provide a definitive diagnosis of some kinds of tumors. The main goal of any non-invasive imaging technique is to determine the location and size of the tumor and also the detection of its infiltration in brain tissue. Many attention was paid for the proper identification of reversible changes of tumor in normal brain tissue, such as edema and translocation. DWI technique has become an important part of MRI for patients suffering from brain tumors. Differential diagnosis of benign and malignant tumors of the brain are vital, and it facilitates to choose strategies for treatment of malignant tumors. Indeed DWI does not need to contrast enhancement, so it is a non-invasive method. Measuring the average of ADC map is helpful, especially when T and T images do not give enough diagnosis information because it provides the study of tissue definitive features. In the present article, the merits and demerits of the techniques have been discussed.","[Sotoodeh, Zainab Yazdi; Sargazi, Vida; Abadi, Ali Jafari Kalil] Zahedan Univ Med Sci, Dept Radiol, Zaheden, Iran","Sotoodeh, ZY (corresponding author), Zahedan Univ Med Sci, Dept Radiol, Zaheden, Iran.","zainab.y31@yahoo.com",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,53,1,1,0,0,"NATL CAVE RESEARCH & PROTECTION ORGANIZATION, INDIA","RAIPUR","3-40 CIVIL LINES, RAJATALAB, RAIPUR, CG 492001, INDIA","2348-5191","2348-8980",NA,"AMBIENT SCI","Ambient Sci.",NA,2018,"5",NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.21276/ambi.2018.05.sp1.ga01",NA,NA,6,"Ecology","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","GM2SO","WOS:000437941300001",NA,"Bronze",NA,NA,"2021-09-23",NA

Theory predicts that such physiological changes should alter prey nutrient demands from N-rich to C-rich macronutrients and shift the balance between maintenance and growth/reproduction. Theory further suggests that for ectotherms, temperature stands to exacerbate this stress. Yet, the interactive effects of predation stress and temperature stress on diet, metabolism, and survival of ectotherms are not well known. This knowledge gap was addressed with a laboratory study in which wild juvenile grasshoppers were collected, assigned to one of three groups, and raised at three different temperatures. All grasshoppers had access to equal quantities of two diets composed of opposite carbohydrate:protein ratios. Half of the individuals in each temperature group were exposed to predation risk cues from spider predators, while the other half were kept in risk free conditions. Grasshoppers consumed more carbohydrates when exposed to predation risk, but consumption favored greater protein intake as temperature increased. Moreover, the difference in carbohydrate intake between risk cue and risk free treatments diminished as temperature increased. Furthermore, variability between individual consumption patterns both within and between treatments decreased markedly as temperature increased, suggesting that higher temperatures promote more consistent individual consumption behaviors. Grasshoppers grew faster and larger as temperature increased, which translated into higher survival rates at higher temperatures. Warmer grasshoppers also did not alter their metabolic rates in response to predation risk cues, in contrast to colder grasshoppers. Digestive efficiency increased with temperature as well -- further indicating that lower temperatures were much more stressful than higher temperatures for grasshoppers. The study shows that physiological responses of ectothermic herbivores to predation stress are highly plastic and temperature dependent, with higher temperatures promoting increased protein intake, growth, development, survival, and digestive efficiency relative to colder temperatures. These findings help to reconcile why dietary responses (proportion of protein vs. carbohydrate intake) to predation stress may vary among different prey taxa studied previously.","[Schmitz, Oswald J.; Rosenblatt, Adam E.; Smylie, Meredith] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Schmitz, OJ (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.","oswald.schmitz@yale.edu",NA,NA,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1354762]; Yale Climate and Energy Institute; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1354762] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Our research was funded by NSF grant DEB-1354762 to OJS and the Yale Climate and Energy Institute to AER.

To assess SES resilience, we constructed an Agent-Based Model (ABM) of a land use system as a stereotypical example of SES and investigated how resilience of the represented system is affected by both external disturbances and internal dynamics. The model explicitly considered different aspects of resilience in a framework derived from literature, which includes resilience to, resilience of, resilience at, resilience due to, and indicators of resilience. External disturbances were implemented as shocks in crop yields. Internal dynamics comprised of two types of social interaction between agents (learning and cooperation), an ecological feedback of soil depletion and an economic feedback of agglomeration benefits. We systematically varied these mechanisms and measured indicators that reflected spatial, social, and economic resilience. Results showed that (1) internal mechanisms increased the ability of the system to recover from external shocks, (2) feedbacks resulted in different regimes of crop cultivation, each with a distinctive set of functions, and (3) resilience is not a generic system property, but strongly depends on what system function is considered. We recommend future studies to include internal dynamics, especially feedbacks, and to systematically assess them across different aspects of resilience.","[Chen, Yang; Ligtenberg, Arend; Bregt, Arnold K.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Chen, Yang; Bakker, Martha M.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Land Use Planning Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands","Chen, Y (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, Dept Urban & Reg Planning & Geoinformat Managemen, Hengelosestr 99, NL-7514 AE Enschede, Netherlands.","y.chen-3@utwente.nl; martha.bakker@wur.nl; arend.ligtenberg@wur.nl; arnold.bregt@wur.nl",NA,"Bregt, Arnold/0000-0001-5797-7208; Chen, Yang/0000-0002-9844-6195","Wageningen University & Research under the program of IP/OP Complex Adaptive Systems","This work was supported by Wageningen University & Research under the program of IP/OP Complex Adaptive Systems.

Perturbations to an ecosystem's steady state can trigger transient responses of great ecological relevance. Asymptotic stability determines whether a generic perturbation will fade out in the long run, but falls short of characterizing the dynamics immediately after an equilibrium has been perturbed. Reactivity, traditionally defined as the maximum instantaneous growth rate of small perturbations to a stable steady state, is a simple yet powerful measure of the short-term instability of a system as a whole. In many ecological applications, however, it could be important to focus on the reactivity properties of just some specific, problem-dependent state variables, such as the abundance of a focal species engaged in interspecific competition, either predators or preys in a trophic community, or infectious individuals in disease transmission. 2. We propose a generalized definition of reactivity (g-reactivity) that allows to evaluate the differential contribution of the state space components to the transient behaviour of an ecological system following a perturbation. Our definition is based on the dynamic analysis of a system output, corresponding to an ecologically motivated linear transformation of the relevant state variables. We demonstrate that the g-reactivity properties of an equilibrium are determined by the dominant eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix that can be easily obtained from the Jacobian associated with the equilibrium and the system output transformation. 3. As a testbed for our methodological framework, we analyse the g-reactivity properties of simple spatially implicit metapopulation models of some prototypical ecological interactions, namely competition, predation and transmission of an infectious disease. We identify conditions for the temporary coexistence of an invader with a (possibly competitively superior) resident species, for transitory invasion of either prey or predator in otherwise predator- or prey-dominated ecosystems, and for transient epidemic outbreaks. 4. Through suitable examples, we show that characterizing the transient dynamics associated with an ecosystem's steady state can be, in some cases, as important as determining its asymptotic behaviour, from both theoretical and management perspective. Because g-reactivity analysis can be performed for systems of any complexity in a relatively straightforward way, we conclude that it may represent a useful addition to the toolbox of quantitative ecologists.","[Mari, Lorenzo; Casagrandi, Renato; Gatto, Marino] Polytech Univ Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Rinaldo, Andrea] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne, Lab Ecohydrol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Rinaldo, Andrea] Univ Padua, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, I-35131 Padua, Italy","Mari, L (corresponding author), Polytech Univ Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, I-20133 Milan, Italy.","lorenzo.mari@polimi.it","Mari, Lorenzo/M-8528-2015; Casagrandi, Renato/L-3985-2013; Gatto, Marino/D-9531-2012","Mari, Lorenzo/0000-0003-1326-9992; Casagrandi, Renato/0000-0001-5177-803X; RINALDO, ANDREA/0000-0002-7854-7992; Gatto, Marino/0000-0001-8063-9178","Politecnico di Milano; ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [RINEC 22172]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [200021 1249301, 31003A 135622, PP00P3 150698]; H2020 project 'ECOPOTENTIAL: Improving future ecosystem benefits through Earth observations' [641762]","L.M., R.C. and M.G. acknowledge support from Politecnico di Milano.

We present results of the first ancient DNA (aDNA) investigation into traditional mortuary practices among Australian Aboriginal people with a focus on North-East Australia. We recovered mitochondrial and Y chromosome sequences from five ancestral Aboriginal Australian remains that were excavated from the Flinders Island group in Cape York, Queensland. Two of these individuals were sampled from disturbed beach burials, while the other three were from bundle burials located in rock shelters. Genomic analyses showed that individuals from all three rock shelter burials and one of the two beach burials had a close genealogical relationship to contemporary individuals from communities from Cape York. In contrast the remaining male individual, found buried on the beach, had a mitochondrial DNA sequence that suggested that he was not from this location but that he was closely related to people from central Queensland or New South Wales. In addition, this individual was associated with a distinctive burial practice to the other four people. It has been suggested that traditionally non-locals or lower status individuals were buried on beaches. Our findings suggest that theories put forward about beach burials being non-local, or less esteemed members of the community, can potentially be resolved through analyses of uniparental genomic data. Generally, these results support the suggestion often derived from ethnohistoric accounts that inequality in Indigenous Australian mortuary practices might be based on the status, sex, and/or age of individuals and may instead relate to place of geographic origin. There is, however, some departure from the traditional ethnohistoric account in that complex mortuary internments were also offered to female individuals of the community, with genomic analyses helping to confirm that the gender of one of the rockshelter internments was that of a young female.","[Wasef, Sally; Wright, Joanne L.; Adams, Shaun; Westaway, Michael C.; Lambert, David] Griffith Univ, Australian Res Ctr Human Evolut, Environm Futures Res Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Westaway, Michael C.] Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Archaeol, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Flinders, Clarence] Cape Melville Flinders & Howick Isl Aboriginal Co, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Willerslev, Eske] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge, England; [Willerslev, Eske] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge, England; [Willerslev, Eske] Univ Copenhagen, Lundbeck Fdn, GeoGenet Ctr, Copenhagen, Denmark","Wasef, S; Lambert, D (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Australian Res Ctr Human Evolut, Environm Futures Res Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia.","s.wasef@griffith.edu.au; d.lambert@griffith.edu.au","Wasef, Sally/L-2853-2016","Wasef, Sally/0000-0002-7207-7395","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP140100387]","This research was possible due to funding from the Australian Research Council LP140100387.",NA,46,3,3,1,5,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2296-701X",NA,NA,"FRONT ECOL EVOL","Front.
