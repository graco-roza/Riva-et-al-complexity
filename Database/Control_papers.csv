This flexibility is typical of the sterile worker class, yet rare in queens. In the little fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata), queens have been reported to perform only egg laying. We examined behavior of queens ofW. auropunctataafter demographic manipulation. When half of the workers were removed from the colony, queens were observed caring for eggs, larvae and pupae as well as eating outside of the nest, like forager workers. We examined the relationship between these atypical queen behaviors and their juvenile hormone binding protein (JHbp) and vitellogenin (Vg) expression via QRT-PCR method.JHbpandVgexpression decreased when queens were performing worker tasks, resembling the expected expression pattern of typical sterile workers. Flexibility in queen behaviors in the little fire ant may be an important adaptation to changing environments. As a significant invasive species, such adaptation may increase the probability of colony survival during propagation. Our results not only present new insights in behavioral flexibility in social insects, but also increases our understanding of the success of this significant invasive species.","[Ortiz-Alvarado, Yarira] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Rivera-Marchand, Bert] Inter Amer Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Nat Sci & Math, Bayamon, PR USA","Ortiz-Alvarado, Y (corresponding author), Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, San Juan, PR 00936 USA.","y.ortizal@gmail.com",NA,"Ortiz-Alvarado, Yarira/0000-0002-3087-9293","PR-LSAMP [1026560]; Agustin Stahl fellowships; Inter American University of Puerto Rico","Financial support was provided by PR-LSAMP (grant no. 1026560) and the Agustin Stahl fellowships awarded to YO-A and the Inter American University of Puerto Rico.",NA,47,3,3,0,10,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2296-701X",NA,NA,"FRONT ECOL EVOL","Front.

For explaining effects on an individual's life-history traits (e.g., growth and reproduction), DEBtox is the leading toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) modelling approach. DEBtox is the application of a model based on dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory to toxic effects, but the term is generally used to refer to practical simplified models from this theoretical framework. The DEBtox approach has remained relatively unchanged over the last few decades, but an updated model is urgently needed. The need for revision is triggered by three, relative recent, developments: the broad acceptance of simple TKTD models for survival (GUTS), the development and successful application of reserve-less DEB models for invertebrates (DEBkiss), and the concrete interest in DEBtox from the field of ERA for pesticides in Europe. In this paper, an updated DEBtox model is presented that is based on DEBkiss, follows the TKTD formulation as established for GUTS (i.e., explicitly taking damage into consideration), and includes a starvation module that is essential for time-varying exposure (as some toxicant action mechanisms may induce starvation). The updated model is illustrated with a case study for springtails exposed to chlorpyrifos in food, and may find applications in science as well as in the regulatory arena.","[Jager, Tjalling] DEBtox Res, De Bilt, Netherlands","Jager, T (corresponding author), DEBtox Res, De Bilt, Netherlands.","tjalling@debtox.nl","Jager, Tjalling/D-8168-2011","Jager, Tjalling/0000-0002-4424-1442",NA,NA,NA,27,9,9,5,16,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0304-3800","1872-7026",NA,"ECOL MODEL","Ecol.

The evaluation was carried out in two stages. At the first stage the degree of pollution of the atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere of the regions was estimated on the basis of emission of pollutants into the atmosphere from stationary sources, formation of solid domestic wastes (SDW), and discharge of contaminated wastewater. Based on these three indicators, a pollution index was constructed that estimates aggregate pollution level. At the second stage the authors estimated the loads generated by atmospheric emissions, solid waste, and waste water discharged into the territory of each region, per capita and in relation to the environmental capacity of the economy. This allows us to take into account the area of pollution, anthropogenic pressure, and environmental responsibility of the population, as well as the environmental friendliness of production. On the basis of relative indicators, the index of ecological tension was created. Approbation was carried out by the example of the regions of Russia for 2014. The series of maps were created based on the obtained results. With the help of the methodology, an analysis of the environmental situation was carried out, some regions with a disproportionately high environmental load were identified. The importance of specific indicators to assess the peculiar ecological footprint of each person or the production of the region is underlined.","[Tikunov, V. S.; Chereshnia, O.

In the tropics these parameters have mostly been investigated in trees and some herbs, but rarely in climbers which frequently: (1) show clonal growth leading to a patchy distribution pattern similar to that of understory herbs; and (2) flower in the canopy where they may have access to long-distance dispersal like canopy trees. We thus hypothesize for climbers an intermediate genetic structure between herbs and trees. The study aims at assessing breeding system and spatial extent of clonality and gene dispersal in Haumania danckelmaniana (Marantaceae), a common climber in the tropical rain forests from western Central Africa. In eastern Cameroon, 330 ramets were sampled at three spatial scales and genotyped at seven microsatellite loci. Clonality was moderate (clonal extend: 15-25 m, clonal diversity 0.4-0.65) indicating the importance of recruitment from seeds at this locality. The low inbreeding (FIS) suggested predominant outcrossing. The rate of decay of the relatedness between individuals with distance indicated limited gene dispersal distance (rg = 9-50 m, neighborhood sizes Nb = 23-67) in accordance with narrowly gravity dispersed seeds and restricted pollen transfer distance in densely flowering populations. The marked SGS (Sp = 0.011-0.026) was similar to that reported in tropical trees, but might increase with augmented clonality as in many herbs, especially under more severe disturbance regimes.","[Ley, Alexandra C.] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Systemat & Biodivers, Neuwerk 21, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Ley, Alexandra C.; Hardy, Olivier J.] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Fac Sci, Evolutionary Biol & Ecol, CP160-12,50 Ave F Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium","Ley, AC (corresponding author), Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Systemat & Biodivers, Neuwerk 21, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.; Ley, AC (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Fac Sci, Evolutionary Biol & Ecol, CP160-12,50 Ave F Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.","alexandra.ley@botanik.uni-halle.de",NA,NA,"Germany Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); Belgian Fund for Scientific Research (F.R.S-FNRS)Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS [MIS 4.519.10, T0163.13]; Belgian Science Policy (Belspo) through project AFRIFORD","We thank the logging company Pallisco for granting access to their concession and K.

Studies in other comparable wetlands from the Caribbean to Australia have shed light on distinctive and puzzling aspects such as the upside-down estuary'' and productivity paradox'' for which the Everglades is known. These studies suggest that coastal wetlands on carbonate (karstic) platforms have: (1) hydrological and biogeochemical properties that reflect hidden'' groundwater sources of water and nutrients, (2) very productive, mat-forming algal communities that present a low-quality food to aquatic consumers that encourages (3) highly diversified feeding strategies within and among populations, and (4) extensive and productive seagrass meadows and mangrove forests that promote strong cultural dependencies associated with the ecosystem services they provide. The contribution of international research to each of these general ecological topics is discussed with a particular goal of encouraging informed decision-making in threatened wetlands across the globe.","[Gaiser, Evelyn E.; Anderson, Elizabeth P.; Collado-Vides, Ligia; Fourqurean, James W.; Heithaus, Michael R.; Jaffe, Rudolf; Oehm, Nicholas J.; Price, Rene M.; Troxler, Tiffany G.] Florida Int Univ, Southeast Environm Res Ctr, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Gaiser, Evelyn E.; Collado-Vides, Ligia; Fourqurean, James W.; Heithaus, Michael R.; Troxler, Tiffany G.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sch Environm Arts & Soc, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Anderson, Elizabeth P.; Price, Rene M.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Sch Environm Arts & Soc, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Castaneda-Moya, Edward; Rivera-Monroy, Victor H.] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Coast & Environm, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Jaffe, Rudolf] Florida Int Univ, Dept Chem, Sch Environm Arts & Soc, Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Lagomasino, David] Univ Space Res Assoc, NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Oehm, Nicholas J.] Florida Int Univ, STEM Transformat Inst, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Chowdhury, Rinku Roy] Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USA","Gaiser, EE (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Southeast Environm Res Ctr, Miami, FL 33199 USA.","gaisere@fiu.edu","Fourqurean, James/AAY-9611-2020; Gaiser, Evelyn/ABG-2507-2020; Rivera-Monroy, Victor H/G-7329-2011; Lagomasino, David/P-8413-2015; Heithaus, Michael/AAF-9914-2020","Fourqurean, James/0000-0002-0811-8500; Gaiser, Evelyn/0000-0003-2065-4821; Lagomasino, David/0000-0003-4008-5363; Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003; Price, Rene/0000-0003-1050-7270; Oehm, Jr., Nicholas J./0000-0001-9013-6750; Castaneda, Edward/0000-0001-7759-4351","Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research program through U.S. National Science Foundation [DEB-9910514, DBI-0620409, DEB-1237517]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE0745606, OCE526065]; George Barley Chair; National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Water Science of Coupled Aquatic Processes in Ecosystems from Space (WaterSCAPES) University Research Center program [NNX-10AQ13]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [CONACyT-Fondo Institucional: I0002, 24847, Etapa: 001]; NASA-JPL project (LSU Subcontract) [1452878]; Southeast Environmental Research Center at FIU [748]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1237517] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This paper was stimulated by conversations at the 2013 meeting of the International Long-Term Ecological Research Network in Seoul, Korea.

One potential midway to enhance the ecological contribution of monoculture plantations is to introduce native tree species in the plantation understory. We conducted phylogenetically explicit enrichment planting experiments beneath the monocultures of two tree species native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest to assess if the evolutionary distance of each seedling species to the overstory tree explained variations in seedling performance. We planted in the understory of two replicate plantations of species Esenbeckia leiocarpa Engl. (Rutaceae; 38 and 25 years old) and Zeyheria tuberculosa (Vell) (Bignoniaceae; both replicates were 30 years old) six native tree species, ranging in their evolutionary distances to these overstory species. We assessed individual seedling survival and height at 1, 7, and 19 months after planting. We found a weak yet significant, positive correlation between seedling performance (growth and survival) and the phylogenetic distance of the planted seedling to the overstory species, which was driven by the poor performance of conspecifics. Seedlings of the same order and class as the overstory trees showed a significantly lower risk of death compared to conspecifics and to the furthest relative, Cryptocarya aschersoniana. These findings highlight that very close relatives to the overstories should be avoided when planting beneath monoculture plantations, but that knowledge on species-specific requirements is still the most important for a successful planting.","[Schweizer, Daniella] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Dept Environm Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schweizer, Daniella; Brancalion, Pedro H.

We evaluated the effectiveness of livestock grazing and cages to exclude rodents by comparing survival of caged and uncaged transplants under two pasture management treatments (grazed vs. ungrazed). We found that transplant survival was greatest for caged plants in grazed pasture with 50% of plants surviving to the end of the second growing season. Grazing increased the species richness in the plant community and decreased the amount of cover for small mammals. Accordingly, rodent density and vole herbivory in late summer were significantly lower on grazed pasture. Our results indicate that rodent herbivores represent a major threat to the survival and reestablishment of autumn buttercup and livestock grazing and protective caging are effective strategies to reduce rodent populations and vole herbivory.","[Skopec, Michele M.; Sandoval, Tyson] Weber State Univ, Dept Zool, 1415 Edvalson St, Ogden, UT 84408 USA; [Lewinsohn, Jennifer] US Fish & Wildlife, Utah Ecol Serv Field Off, 2369 West Orton Circle, West Valley City, UT 84119 USA; [Wirick, Clint] US Fish & Wildlife, Partners Fish & Wildlife Program Utah, 240 North 600 East, Richfield, UT 84701 USA; [Murray, Sheila] Arboretum Flagstaff, 4001 S Woody Mt Rd, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Pence, Valerie] Cincinnati Zoo & Bot Gardens, Ctr Conservat & Res Endangered Wildlife, 3400 Vine St, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA; [Whitham, Linda] Nature Conservancy, 820 Kane Creek Blvd, Moab, UT 84532 USA","Skopec, MM (corresponding author), Weber State Univ, Dept Zool, 1415 Edvalson St, Ogden, UT 84408 USA.","micheleskopec@weber.edu",NA,"Skopec, Michele/0000-0002-0107-2765","Nature Conservancy; U.S. Fish and WildlifeUS Fish & Wildlife Service; Weber State University","We thank J.

Although both types of stands, which are of the same age, developed spontaneously, the alder stands occupied damper sites (with thicker A horizons that survived the fire) than those in the birch forests. We surveyed the migration rates of 44 woodland species, primarily ancient woodland indicators, into both forests and the potential differences in these rates depending on their moisture regime and the community type represented by unburned forests, which were treated as the source of the woodland species pool. Additionally, the role of local depressions with high humidity that were covered by post-fire alder woods in the colonization process, as well as species survivorship and recolonisation, were estimated. Woodland species showed diverse migration paces among the sites; most of them migrated faster on more fertile sites with a higher humidity. Small patches of post-fire alder woods contributed to the recolonisation process since many woodland species in the herb layer survived the fire due to its high humidity, which inhibited the intensity of the forest fire. The recovery of woodland species in post-fire woods is the combined effect of regeneration, which relies on autochthonic propagules, and secondary succession, which is based on allochthonic propagules. Local depressions, which provide refuges for fire-sensitive, dispersal-limited species, contribute to their survivorship and thus to the successive recovery of herbaceous layers after a fire.","[Orczewska, Anna; Prukop, Marcin; Strzelczyk, Adriana] Univ Silesia, Dept Ecol, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, PL-40007 Katowice, Poland","Orczewska, A (corresponding author), Univ Silesia, Dept Ecol, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Ul Bankowa 9, PL-40007 Katowice, Poland.","anna.orczewska@us.edu.pl",NA,"Orczewska, Anna/0000-0002-7924-9794",NA,NA,NA,45,1,1,0,15,"SPRINGER JAPAN KK","TOKYO","CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN","0912-3814","1440-1703",NA,"ECOL RES","Ecol.

Stable isotope analysis provides a powerful tool to identify the energy sources which fuel consumers, to understand trophic interactions and to infer consumer trophic position (TP), an important concept that describes the ecological role of consumers in food webs. However, current methods for estimating TP using stable isotopes are limited and do not fulfil the complete potential of the isotopic approach. For instance, researchers typically use point estimates for key parameters including trophic discrimination factors and isotopic baselines, and do not explicitly include variance associated with these parameters when calculating TP. 2. We present TROPHICPOSITION, an R package incorporating a Bayesian model for the calculation of consumer TP at the population level using stable isotopes, with one or two baselines. It combines Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations through JAGS and statistical and graphical analyses using R. We model consumer and baseline observations using relevant statistical distributions, allowing them to be treated as random variables. The calculation of TPa random parameterfor one baseline follows standard equations linking N-15 enrichment per trophic level and the trophic position of the baseline (e.g. a primary producer or primary consumer). In the case of two baselines, a simple mixing model incorporating delta C-13 allows for the differentiation between two distinct sources of nitrogen, thus including heterogeneity derived from alternatives sources of delta N-15. 3. Methods currently implemented in tRophicPosition include loading, plotting and summarizing stable isotope data either from multiple sites and/or communities or a local assemblage; loading trophic discrimination factors from an internal database or generating them; defining and initializing a Bayesian model of TP; sampling posterior parameters; analysing, comparing and plotting posterior estimates of TP and other parameters; and calculating a parametric (non-Bayesian) TP estimate.

In aquatic ecosystems, plant detritus has been considered the predominant form of such subsidies; however, while considered less abundant in many ecosystems, carrion represents subsidies with relatively rapid turnover and highly concentrated nutrient and energy release that can have strong and lasting effects on ecosystems. Carrion subsidies can be both autochthonous or allochthonous, and come in the form of natural senescence or disease-related non-consumptive mortality, phenology-based programed death (e.g., salmon spawning and death), or stochastic and episodic events (e.g., mass fish die-offs). All aquatic ecosystems have some level of non-consumptive mortality that provides a background level of carcasses to aquatic ecosystems, while others have a natural history of carrion resource subsidies (e.g., natural salmon-bearing streams), and some have only recently been exposed to phenology-based carrion subsidies (e.g., anthropogenic salmon introductions around the world). Many aquatic ecosystems experience episodic subsidies in the form of unexpected mass mortalities (e.g., eutrophication-, disease-, or climate-related mass die-offs) or have seasonally dependent pulses, like that of marine or lake snow in the form of zooplankton carcasses. The responses of ecosystems to these different histories and frequencies of carrion subsidies have often been independently investigated, with little effort to compare and bridge research boundaries in the broader context of resource subsidies. In this review, we provide a synthesis of how pulsed carrion nutrient and energy subsidies have widespread and lasting impacts on many aquatic ecosystems. We do this with a synthesis of literature from freshwater and marine ecosystems along three themes of how carrion is produced and decomposes: autochthonous and allochthonous necromass; phenology-based mortality; and stochastic and episodic mass mortality subsidies. Studies of charismatic megafauna carrion (e.g., whales) have described significant impacts in deep ocean systems, but much less is understood for other groups of animals. Quantifying the energy, nutrient, and foodweb effects of carrion is needed for more species and among habitats to more fully understand how ubiquitous forms of necromass contribute to aquatic ecosystem structure and function.","[Benbow, M.

We used ecological niche modeling approaches: For biotic interactions, an initial host model was incorporated into the calibration of the parasite model and an initial parasite model was incorporated into calibration of the host model, as host and parasite populations may respond to the presence of the other species. Absence of olive fruits could reduce the flight ability of the fly parasite, whereas presence of the parasite may make a site less suitable for the olives. The host model was improved by inclusion of the parasite information; the converse was not true for the parasite model. Our results anticipated a significant reduction in the potential distribution of Olea europeae in Africa and Europe under future climate scenarios; in contrast, future climates appear more broadly favorable for the parasite species, which poses new and increasing risks for olive cultivation in the Mediterranean region.","[Ashraf, Uzma; Chaudhry, Muhammad Nawaz] Lahore Sch Econ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Lahore 55000, Pakistan; [Peterson, A.

In this way, it becomes possible to make meaningful comparisons among ecosystems and communities and to predict how plant communities might respond to changes in their environment. Here, we classified common alpine plants which occur in snowpatches (Early and Late snowmelt sites) and in adjacent vegetation (Snow-free sites which melt early in the growing season) using Grime's CSR plant strategy scheme. Alpine plant communities are largely driven by environmental filters associated with a relatively constant gradient of snowmelt timing. Since snow persistence influences the abiotic environment and plant assemblages alike, we hypothesised that these patterns would be reflected in community CSR scores. Weighted community CSR scores were clustered towards the stress-tolerator (S) corner of the triangular CSR space, and Snow-free communities were significantly more stress-tolerant than Early and Late snowmelt communities. This suggests that snowpatch communities are functionally distinct from surrounding vegetation when considering the major axes of plant variation identified by CSR theory. These results lend further support to the importance of the timing of snowmelt as a key filter, influencing how species and plant strategy types distribute themselves across the alpine landscape.

Global climate warming has led to the increased potential for forest insects to invade novel habitats of native hosts within the same landmass. The mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) has recently expanded into higher-latitude forests of the principal host, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), and the susceptibility of trees is greater in these systems compared to forests in the native range. We assessed the contribution of the induced defensive response of hosts to this elevated susceptibility, and whether these discrepancies are the result of coevolution with host populations within the historic native range of the insect. We challenged trees using paired treatments of a beetle-attack simulation and a generic defensive response elicitor ( methyl jasmonate) to mitigate variability in the induced response among trees within and among populations, from within and outside the historic range of the beetle. We then assessed the production of monoterpene chemicals by the trees in response to treatments using gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. The differential induction of monoterpenes in response to simulated beetle attack relative to the generic elicitor was highest in populations with the highest putative historic exposure to MPB. Elevated susceptibility and invasion potential of the beetle in novel systems is the proximate result of reduced defensive capacity, ultimately arising from a lack of coevolution with the beetle in novel systems. In forested systems with climate-driven herbivore-host distributional asymmetry, continued warming will potentially exacerbate the impacts of aggressive insect herbivores as they invade defensively naive host populations.","[Burke, Jordan Lewis; Bohlmann, Joerg; Carroll, Allan L.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Bohlmann, Joerg] Univ British Columbia, Michael Smith Labs, 2185 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Burke, JL (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.","jordan.lewis.burke@gmail.com",NA,NA,"British Columbia Future Forest Ecosystem Science Council; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Strategic Network-TRIA-Net Turning Risk Into Action for the Mountain Pine Beetle Epidemic; University of British Columbia","Funding for this research was provided by the British Columbia Future Forest Ecosystem Science Council (www.gov.bc.ca/nro), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Strategic Network-TRIA-Net Turning Risk Into Action for the Mountain Pine Beetle Epidemic (tria-net.srv.ualberta.ca/), and the University of British Columbia (www.ubc.ca).

When considered relative to total body mass, however, Willow Warblers had the highest CWL of the three species. Blackcaps started panting at lower ambient temperature than the other two species. Taken together, these results suggest that Willow Warblers are the most efficient in cooling their body, possibly with the cost of needing to regain water by actively foraging during their staging. Lesser Whitethroats had a similar pattern, which was reflected in their slightly higher levels of activity and drinking behavior when water was available. However, in general the behavior of migratory species was not affected by the availability of water, and they were observed drinking rather rarely. Our results indicate that differences in thermoregulatory mechanisms might be at the basis of the evolution of different stopover strategies of migratory birds while crossing arid areas such as deserts.","[Paces, Bernhard; Waringer, Barbara M.] Univ Vienna, Fac Life Sci, Dept Bot & Biodivers Res, Div Trop Ecol & Anim Biodivers, Vienna, Austria; [Domer, Adi; Burns, Darren; Zvik, Yoram; Shochat, Eyal] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Zvik, Yoram] Hoopoe Ornithol & Ecol Ctr, Yeroham, Israel; [Wojciechowski, Michat S.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Biol & Vet Sci, Dept Vertebrate Zool & Ecol, Torun, Poland; [Sapir, Nir] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, Haifa, Israel; [Sapir, Nir] Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, Haifa, Israel; [Maggini, Ivan] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, Vienna, Austria","Maggini, I (corresponding author), Univ Vet Med Vienna, Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, Vienna, Austria.","ivan.maggini@vetmeduni.ac.at",NA,NA,"University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; The University of Vienna; Needs-based Scholarship (Forderstipendium); Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [702/17]; Polish National Science Centre [2017/25/B/NZ8/00541]","This study was supported by a start-up grant (Profillinien) of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna to IM.

Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in ecology and related fields. They are frequently adopted to predict the expected occurrence (presence/absence) or abundance over large spatial scales, that is, to produce a species distribution map. Two issues that almost universally affect these models are measurement errors (especially imperfect detection) and residual spatial autocorrelation. 2. We explored the effects of imperfect detection and autocorrelation in abundance models by simulating datasets which did or did not contain these two effects and analysing them with four different models that did or did not accommodate them. Specifically, we used a Poisson GLM as a baseline, an N-mixture model accounting only for imperfect detection and two N-mixture models that accounted for imperfect detection, but differed in their specification of spatial autocorrelation (CAR random effects vs. two-dimensional splines). 3. In a case study, we then applied these models to Common Redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus data from the second Swiss Breeding Bird Atlas (1993-1996) and validated them using an independent monitoring dataset. 4. We found that both imperfect detection and autocorrelation strongly affected the quality and the uncertainty of abundance maps, especially when they occurred together. Spatial N-mixture models were well able to estimate the true abundance maps. Explicit modelling of measurement error and spatial autocorrelation can thus greatly improve the quality of SDMs and should not be ignored when producing large-scale abundance or occurrence maps.","[Guelat, Jerome; Kery, Marc] Swiss Ornithol Inst, Sempach, Switzerland","Guelat, J (corresponding author), Swiss Ornithol Inst, Sempach, Switzerland.","jerome.guelat@vogelwarte.ch",NA,"Guelat, Jerome/0000-0003-1438-4378","Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [31003A_146125]","This work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant number 31003A_146125 to M.K. and Michael Schaub).

TL is widely verified. We show here that empirical time series of density of the Hokkaido gray-sided vole, Myodes rufocanus, sampled 1962-1992 at 85 locations, satisfied temporal and spatial forms of TL. The slopes (b +/- standard error) of the temporal and spatial TL were estimated to be 1.613 +/- 0.141 and 1.430 +/- 0.132, respectively. A previously verified autoregressive Gompertz model of the dynamics of these populations generated time series of density which reproduced the form of temporal and spatial TLs, but with slopes that were significantly steeper than the slopes estimated from data. The density-dependent components of the Gompertz model were essential for the temporal TL. Adding to the Gompertz model assumptions that populations with higher mean density have reduced variance of density-independent perturbations and that density-independent perturbations are spatially correlated among populations yielded simulated time series that satisfactorily reproduced the slopes from data. The slopes (b +/- standard error) of the enhanced simulations were 1.619 +/- 0.199 for temporal TL and 1.575 +/- 0.204 for spatial TL.","[Cohen, Joel E.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Populat, 1230 York Ave,Box 20, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Cohen, Joel E.] Columbia Univ, 1230 York Ave,Box 20, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Cohen, Joel E.] Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Cohen, Joel E.] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, 5747 South Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Saitoh, Takashi] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr, North 11,West 10, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600811, Japan","Cohen, JE (corresponding author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Populat, 1230 York Ave,Box 20, New York, NY 10065 USA.; Cohen, JE (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, 1230 York Ave,Box 20, New York, NY 10065 USA.; Cohen, JE (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA.; Cohen, JE (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, 5747 South Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.","cohen@rockefeller.edu","Saitoh, Takashi/D-6021-2012","Saitoh, Takashi/0000-0003-4085-5014","U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-1225529]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26291086] Funding Source: KAKEN; Direct For Mathematical & Physical ScienNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1225529] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","T.

Classic models of interacting species have provided a basis for our understanding of stability in these systems, and suggest that stable coexistence requires weak, rare, and asymmetric interactions. But missing from these models is an explicit understanding of how resource exchange and resource limitation can drive or prevent instability. Here, we show that systems based on general rules for the consumption and exchange of resources are guaranteed to be stable when exchange of resources is reciprocated by each pair of partners. These cooperative, mutualistic interactions can be arbitrarily strong and yet not disrupt stability. More general modes of exchange will lead to instability when supply rates are low, but when resource supply from outside the system is sufficiently high, arbitrary exchange is consistent with a stable equilibrium.","[Butler, Stacey; O'Dwyer, James P.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","O'Dwyer, JP (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.","srbutle1@illinois.edu; jodwyer@illinois.edu",NA,NA,"Simons Foundation [376199]; McDonnell Foundation [220020439]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB1557192]","This study is supported by the Simons Foundation Grant No. 376199, McDonnell Foundation Grant NO. 220020439, NSF No. DEB1557192.",NA,56,5,5,2,6,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1874-1738","1874-1746",NA,"THEOR ECOL-NETH","Theor.

We hypothesise that for a given life form like trees, greater harshness leads to a smaller range of traits that are viable and thereby also to lower species diversity. On the basis of a strong dependence of maximum tree height on site productivity and other measures of site quality, we propose maximum tree height as an inverse measure of environmental harshness for trees. Our results show that tree species richness is strongly positively correlated with maximum tree height across multiple spatial scales in forests of both eastern and western North America. Maximum tree height co-varied with species richness along gradients from benign to harsh environmental conditions, which supports the hypothesis that harshness may be a general mechanism limiting local diversity and explaining diversity gradients within a biogeographic region.","[Marks, Christian O.] Nat Conservancys, Northampton, MA 01060 USA; [Muller-Landau, Helene C.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama; [Tilman, David] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Marks, CO (corresponding author), Nat Conservancys, Northampton, MA 01060 USA.","cmarks@tnc.org","Marks, Christian O./F-7403-2012","Marks, Christian O./0000-0002-8936-4753; Muller-Landau, Helene/0000-0002-3526-9021","University of MinnesotaUniversity of Minnesota System; David and Lucile Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; Fonds Quebecois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les TechnologiesFQRNT","We thank Joe Wright, two anonymous reviewers and editors Tim Coulson and Richard Bardgett for comments on earlier drafts, and Charles 'Hobie' Perry for help with the FIA data.

To explore the dynamics of growth in migratory bull trout, one of the models, the von Bertalanffy model, was also fitted based on age estimates derived from annuli and growth increments on pelvic fin ray sections for three juvenile outmigration age groups. Among five growth models evaluated, four models fitted to the age-length data described the fish growth for ages 3 to 11 comparably well. Only a model that exhibited positive growth acceleration as age progressed fitted the data less effectively. Growth was significantly (P < 0.001) related to the age of outmigration from natal streams (1-3 years). Migratory bull trout were found to reach maturation at ages 4-6; the common age-4 maturation was younger than most comparable studies. All mature fish studied reared for 2-3 years in downriver or reservoir habitat. As the adult population size has continued to increase since harvest closure in 1994, further research should be directed towards understanding the trade-offs between these increasing numbers of adult fish and growth, survival, migration, and maturation schedules.","[Erhardt, John M.; Scarnecchia, Dennis L.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Erhardt, JM (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.","jerhardt@usgs.gov",NA,NA,"daho Department of Fish and Game","We thank colleagues at the University of Idaho Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources for their efforts which contributed to this study.

Eighteen individuals of Gabela akalat were captured and radio-tracked with the objectives of establishing their territory size (through home-range size estimates) and habitat preferences using compositional analysis. Home-range sizes were slightly larger than other Sheppardia species and Gabela akalat evidently avoided clearings and preferred forest habitat, although it was also able to use farmland areas and secondary growth to a lesser extent. Conservation measures should focus on the preservation of remaining old-growth forest through the establishment of a nature reserve in Kumbira. To assure the success of such an initiative, the local population should participate in planning, administration and enforcement.

We use the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List Criteria for ecosystems to assess the risk of ecosystem collapse in Australian alpine snow patch herbfields. These ecosystems occur on both mainland Australia and Tasmania. They are restricted to steep, south-easterly slopes where snow pack persists well into the summer growing season. Consequently, they are rare, and have high conservation significance. We evaluated the risk of snow patch herbfield ecosystem collapse' against criteria that accounted for the ecosystem's restricted distribution, projected decline in the snowpack and increased rates of invasion by taller growing native species of shrub and grass. Our analyses revealed considerable uncertainty in estimates of risk based on some criteria, particularly those related to thresholds of ecosystem collapse caused by biotic change. On the basis of the IUCN Red List criteria, we conclude that the ecosystem is endangered'. This is because of the restricted geographical distribution of the ecosystem, a substantial and highly likely decline in the abundance of snow (the principal abiotic driver of the ecosystem), and the prospect of invasion of much of the ecosystem by taller growing native shrubs and grasses. Our case study demonstrates the utility of the Red List methodology for assessing risks to biodiversity in rare ecosystems where changes to both abiotic factors and the relative dominance of native species constitute major threats. Our findings indicate the importance of snow patch herbfields as refugia for dwarf alpine plant species in the face of climate change, the need for continued monitoring, the removal of feral animals from the Australian Alps and scenario planning.","[Williams, R.

These strategies may lead to increased dietary overlap when competition for resources is strong. To quantify temporal contributions of high (C-3) versus low quality (C-4) resources in diets of silky pocket mice (Perognathus flavus), we used stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) analysis of 1391 plasma samples collected over 2years. Of these, 695 samples were from 170 individuals sampled >= 3 times across seasons or years, allowing us to assess changes in dietary breadth at the population and individual levels across a boom-bust population cycle. In 2014, the P. flavus population increased to 412 captures compared to 8 captures in prior and subsequent years, while populations of co-occurring small mammals remained stable. As intraspecific competition increased, the population-wide dietary niche of P. flavus did not change, but individual specialization increased significantly. During this period, similar to 27% (41/151) of individuals sampled specialized on C-3 resources, which were abundant during the spring and previous fall seasons. Most of the remaining individuals were C-3-C-4 generalists (64%) (96/151), and only 9% (14/151) specialized on C-4 resources. In 2015, P. flavus population density and resource availability declined, individual dietary breadth expanded (84% generalists), no C-3 specialists were found, and specialization on C-4 resources increased (16%). Our results demonstrate a high degree of inter-individual plasticity in P. flavus foraging strategies, which has implications for how this species will respond to environmental change that is predicted to decrease C-3 resources in the future.","[Noble, Jennifer D.; Collins, Scott L.; Hallmark, Alesia J.; Wolf, Blair O.; Newsome, Seth D.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Maldonado, Karin] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Artes Liberales, Dept Ciencias, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Santiago, Chile","Collins, SL (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.","scollins@unm.edu","Collins, Scott L/P-7742-2014; MALDONADO, KARIN/T-1302-2019","Collins, Scott L/0000-0002-0193-2892; Hallmark, Alesia/0000-0002-1024-5779","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF)","We thank N.

Climate change indirectly affects forest ecosystems through changes in the frequency, size, and/or severity of wildfires. In addition to its direct effects prior to fire, climate also influences immediate postfire recruitment, with consequences for future vegetation structure and fire activity. A major uncertainty, therefore, is if, when and where vegetation shifts will occur. 2. With an emphasis on species traits, we use a demographic framework to examine how the interaction of changing climate and fire will affect postfire woody vegetation recruitment and the likelihood of vegetation shifts. Each demographic stage - adult mortality, propagule availability, seed germination, seedling establishment, and seedling survival - serves as a filter through which a species must pass for establishment and recovery to occur. 3. We apply this framework to case studies in western North American forests, including boreal and southwestern U.S. Pinus ponderosa forests, to help understand the mechanisms behind recent postfire vegetation changes. The case studies highlight how changes in climate and fire properties will make it increasingly difficult for some species to pass through each demographic filter in the future. 4. As climate warming continues, we expect increased dominance of species that resprout following fire, maintain canopy or soil seed banks, have long distance seed dispersal, produce drought-tolerant seedlings, and/or reach reproductive maturity quickly. The persistence of postfire vegetation shifts will depend the on ratio of recovery time to disturbance interval(s). 5. An advantage of the demographic-filter framework is that it places emphasis on mechanisms, thus improving our ability to anticipate future vegetation shifts. As such, it highlights the clear need for more mechanistic studies of postfire recruitment to disentangle the relative effects of multiple drivers in postfire environments.","[Davis, Kimberley T.; Higuera, Philip E.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Sala, Anna] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Davis, KT (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.","kimberley.davis@umontana.edu","Higuera, Philip Edward/B-1330-2010; Davis, Kimberley Taylor/A-4797-2017","Higuera, Philip Edward/0000-0001-5396-9956; Davis, Kimberley Taylor/0000-0001-9727-374X","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS 1461576]; Joint Fire Science Program [15-1-07-30, 16-1-01-15]","National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: BCS 1461576; Joint Fire Science Program, Grant/Award Number: 15-1-07-30 and 16-1-01-15",NA,174,26,26,1,51,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0269-8463","1365-2435",NA,"FUNCT ECOL","Funct.

Most notably for ecologists, POMDPs have helped solve the trade-offs between investing in management or surveillance and, more recently, to optimise adaptive management problems. Despite an increasing number of applications in ecology and natural resources, POMDPs are still poorly understood. The complexity of the mathematics, the inaccessibility of POMDP solvers developed by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community, and the lack of introductory material are likely reasons for this. We propose to bridge this gap by providing a primer on POMDPs, a typology of case studies drawn from the literature, and a repository of POMDP problems. We explain the steps required to define a POMDP when the state of the system is imperfectly detected (state uncertainty) and when the dynamics of the system are unknown (model uncertainty). We provide input files and solutions to a selected number of problems, reflect on lessons learned applying these models over the last 10 years and discuss future research required on interpretable AI. Partially observable Markov decision processes are powerful decision models that allow users to make decisions under imperfect observations over time.

Among them, Nosema ceranae is an intracellular microsporidian parasite, which plays a major impact on honey bees colonies. However, both efficiency and innocuity of current treatment against N. ceranae are being questioned, thus raising the urgent need to develop alternative prophylactic and curative strategies. Endogenous microbial communities (i.e., host microbiota) are known to play a major role in disease prevention, and more recently both bacterial and yeast strains issued from gut microbiota were observed to improve hosts resistance against intracellular parasites both in mammals and insect models. The use of probiotics in honey bee nutrition is therefore promising to treat or prevent diseases. Therefore, further investigations are needed to properly select microorganisms with probiotic properties. In an in vivo experimental infection by N. ceranae, the probiotic effect of two honeybee gut bacterial strains (Parasacchanbacter apium (PC1 sp.) and Bacillus sp. (PC2 sp.)), and two broad spectra probiotics (Bactocell (R) and Levucell SB (R)) has been measured. Both curative and prophylactic administrations were tested: honey bees infected with N. ceranae and noninfected. For the four probiotic candidates, significant increases of survival probabilities (20-30%) were measured after two weeks of treatment with the administration of 10(3) CFU/mL in sugar syrup, both in curative and prophylactic treatments. The present study shows that endogenous bacterial strains were at least as much efficient and safe than broad spectra probiotics in increasing survival in the context of experimental infection with N. ceranae. Therefore, taking advantage of beneficial host microbiota properties is a promising avenue to develop efficient and sustainable curative strategies against opportunistic diseases in honey bee colonies.","[El Khoury, Sarah; Cheaib, Bachar; Bouslama, Sidki; Mercier, Pierre-Luc; Giovenazzo, Pierre; Derome, Nicolas] Univ Laval, Inst Biol Integrat & Syst, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Rousseau, Andree] Ctr Rech Sci Anim, Prod Apicole, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Lecoeur, Alexandre] Univ Paris Diderot, UFR Sci Vivant, Paris, France; [Demey, Vanessa; Castex, Mathieu] Lallemand SAS, Blagnac, France","Derome, N (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Inst Biol Integrat & Syst, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.","nicolas.derome@bio.ulaval.ca",NA,"Bouslama, Sidki/0000-0001-8715-0420; Rousseau, Andree/0000-0002-2563-4849; Cheaib, Bachar/0000-0002-0325-823X","Agri-Innovation programme from Agriculture and Agri-Food CanadaAgriculture & Agri Food Canada [14-AP-247]","This work was funded with the Agri-Innovation programme from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

This expansion poses a great challenge because crop production is an activity that profoundly affects natural habitats and biodiversity. An interesting perspective for biodiversity conservation is the incorporation of production systems into overall conservation efforts. Rice is one of the world's major crops and Brazil is the leader in the Western Hemisphere with 35% of the cultivated area. Rice fields are sometimes considered man-made wetlands with potential values for many aquatic species. The main goal of this paper is to synthesize results of studies carried out over the past decade in rice fields of southern Brazil to identify management practices that enhance biodiversity levels in agricultural matrices. We also provide direction to environmentally-oriented legislators for implementing general strategies for rice farmers to supplement aquatic diversity of natural wetlands. Major techniques include: 1) keeping some rice fields flooded during the fallow phase; 2) increasing organic rice production to reduce the use of pesticides; 3) encouraging rice farmers to rejuvenate soils by periodically taking fields out of production; and 4) avoid draining new wetlands for rice production. Incentivizing good management practices in rice fields would transfer some of the responsibilities related to the conservation of biodiversity to production systems.

The present study sought to quantify the amount of carbon and water stored by Tillandsia latifolia Meyen in a tillandsial lomas of Lima (Piedra Campana, Canete-Lima). To do this, all the slopes and ravines of a tillandsial sector were evaluated; aerial biomass was weighed and soil samples were collected (first 10 cm); the percentage of water and carbon stored in the biomass, and the carbon in the soil samples were measured. All the data obtained were processed using the kriging interpolation technique. Total carbon measured was 94.10 tons (t) (3.63 t/ha) with more carbon stored in the part of the soil (76.50 t) than in the aerial part (17.60 t). The amount of carbon stored by this tillandsial lomas is below that of several ecosystems that are used as compensation of CO2 emissions such as wetlands or Amazonian vegetation. On the other hand, the water stored amounted to 164 thousand liters, a value that is important as a water reserve in this desert region. The implications of the results obtained for the assessment and management of this desert ecosystem are discussed.","[Arevalo, Jefree] Univ Cient Sur, Ingn Ambiental, Fac Ciencias Ambientales, Av Antigua Carretera Panamer Sur Km 19, Lima 42, Peru; [Aponte, Hector] Univ Cient Sur, Biol Marina, Fac Ciencias Vet & Biol, Av Antigua Carretera Panamer Sur,Km 19, Lima 42, Peru; [Aponte, Hector] Univ Nacl Mayor San Marcos, Lab Florist, Dept Dicotiledoneas, Museo Hist Nat, Ave Arenales 1256,Apartado 14-0434, Lima 14, Peru","Arevalo, J (corresponding author), Univ Cient Sur, Ingn Ambiental, Fac Ciencias Ambientales, Av Antigua Carretera Panamer Sur Km 19, Lima 42, Peru.","je-free@hotmail.com; haponte@cientifica.edu.pe","Aponte, Hector/AAW-6467-2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,24,1,1,1,1,"UNIV NACIONAL AGRARIA LA MOLINA","LIMA","LA MOLINA, LIMA, 00000, PERU","1726-2216","1993-9507",NA,"ECOL APL","Ecol.

Nevertheless, estimation of biodiversity using ecological field data can be difficult for several reasons. For instance, for very large areas, it is challenging to collect data that provide reliable information. Some of these restrictions in Earth observation can be avoided through the use of remote sensing approaches. Various studies have estimated biodiversity on the basis of the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH). According to this hypothesis, spectral heterogeneity over the different pixel units of a spatial grid reflects a higher niche heterogeneity, allowing more organisms to coexist. Recently, the spectral species concept has been derived, following the consideration that spectral heterogeneity at a landscape scale corresponds to a combination of subspaces sharing a similar spectral signature. With the use of high resolution remote sensing data, on a local scale, these subspaces can be identified as separate spectral entities, the so called spectral species. Our approach extends this concept over wide spatial extents and to a higher level of biological organization. We applied this method to MODIS imagery data across Europe. Obviously, in this case, a spectral species identified by MODIS is not associated to a single plant species in the field but rather to a species assemblage, habitat, or ecosystem. Based on such spectral information, we propose a straightforward method to derive a-(local relative abundance and richness of spectral species) and fl-diversity (turnover of spectral species) maps over wide geographical areas.","[Rocchini, Duccio; Chiarucci, Alessandro] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Via Irnerio 42, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Rocchini, Duccio; Malavasi, Marco; Moudry, Vitezslav; Simova, Petra] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Appl Geoinformat & Spatial Planning, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Salvatori, Nicole] Univ Udine, Dept Agrifood Anim & Environm Sci DI4A, Via Sci 206, I-33100 Udine, UD, Italy; [Salvatori, Nicole] Univ Trieste, Dept Life Sci, Via Giorgieri 5, I-34100 Trieste, TS, Italy; [Beierkuhnlein, Carl] Univ Bayreuth, BayCEER, Biogeog, Univ Str 30, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [de Boissieu, Florian; Feret, Jean-Baptiste] IRSTEA Montpellier, UMR TETIS, 500 Rue JF Breton, F-34093 Montpellier 5, France; [Foerster, Michael; Kleinschmit, Birgit] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Geoinformat Environm Planning, Str 17 Juni 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Garzon-Lopez, Carol X.] Univ los Andes, Ecol & Vegetat Physiol Grp EcoFiv, Cr 1E 18A, Bogota, Colombia; [Gillespie, Thomas W.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hauffe, Heidi C.] Fdn Edmund Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, Dept Biodivers & Mol Ecol, Via E Mach 1, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy; [He, Kate S.] Murray State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Murray, KY 42071 USA; [Lenoir, Jonathan] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, UR Ecol & Dynam Syst Anthropises, EDYSAN, UMR 7058 CNRS UPJV, 1 Rue Louvels, F-80037 Amiens 1, France; [Nagendra, Harini] Azim Premji Univ, PES Inst Technol Campus, Pixel Pk,B Block,Hosur Rd, Bangalore 560100, Karnataka, India; [Payne, Davnah] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, GMBA Off, Altenbergrain 21, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Torresani, Michele] Free Univ Bolzano Bozen, Fac Sci & Technol, Piazza Univ,Univ Pl 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Bozen, Italy; [Wegmann, Martin] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Remote Sensing, Remote Sensing & Biodivers Res Grp, Wurzburg, Germany; [Torresani, Michele] Univ Trento, Dept Civil Environm & Mech Engn, Atmospher Phys Grp, Via Mesiano 77, I-38123 Trento, Italy","Rocchini, D (corresponding author), Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Via Irnerio 42, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.","duccio.rocchini@unibo.it","Chiarucci, Alessandro/D-2622-2009; Feret, Jean-Baptiste/A-8351-2013; Simova, Petra/P-2904-2014","Chiarucci, Alessandro/0000-0003-1160-235X; Moudry, Vitezslav/0000-0002-3194-451X; Feret, Jean-Baptiste/0000-0002-0151-1334; Malavasi, Marco/0000-0002-9639-1784; Simova, Petra/0000-0003-2480-1171","H2020 project SHOWCASE; H2020 COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [CA17134, CA15212]; Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR)European Commission [ANR-17-CE32-0001]; French Space Agency (CNES)Centre National D'etudes Spatiales","DR was partially supported by the H2020 project SHOWCASE and by the H2020 COST Action CA17134 Optical synergies for spatiotemporal sensing of scalable ecophysiological traits (SENSECO).

Thus, evaluating the risk of losing ecosystem services due to wildfires is essential for anticipating and adapting to future conditions. Here, we analyze the spatial patterns of the risk of losing key forest ES and biodiversity (that is, carbon sink, bird richness, hydrological control and erosion control) due to wildfires in Catalonia (NE Spain), taking into account exposed values, hazard magnitude, susceptibility and lack of adaptive capacity. We also determine the effect of climate and different forest functional types on the risk of losing ES under average and extreme hazard conditions (defined as median and 90th percentile values of the Fire Weather Index, respectively), as well as on the increase in risk. Our results show that hazard magnitude is the most important component defining risk under average conditions. Under extreme conditions, exposed values (carbon sink capacity and erosion control) emerged as the most important components of risk. Climate was the main driver of ES at risk under average conditions, but the high vulnerability of non-Mediterranean conifer forests with a low adaptive capacity gained importance under extreme conditions. The increase in risk between average and extreme conditions was driven by precipitation, as the highest increases in risk were found in relatively wet forests with low average risk at present. These results have direct implications on the future risk of losing ES to wildfires in Mediterranean forests but also in other regions, and they could contribute to future policies by anticipating conditions associated with particularly high risk that can be used to guide efficient forest management.","[Lecina-Diaz, Judit; Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi; Alvarez, Albert; Vayreda, Jordi; Retana, Javier] CREAF, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalonia, Spain; [Lecina-Diaz, Judit] InBIO CIBIO Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos, Campus Agrario Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas 7, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi; Retana, Javier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalonia, Spain","Lecina-Diaz, J (corresponding author), CREAF, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalonia, Spain.; Lecina-Diaz, J (corresponding author), InBIO CIBIO Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos, Campus Agrario Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas 7, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal.","j.lecina@creaf.uab.cat",NA,NA,"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2015-073854, CGL2014-59742- C2-1-R, CGL2017-89999-C2-1-R]; FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology, I.P., under the FirESmart Project [PCIF/MOG/0083/2017]","We are grateful to Miquel de Caceres for sharing data of the model De Caceres and others (2015).

Functional groups have been commonly used to capture the diversity of forms and functions and thus simplify the reality. However, the explicit incorporation of species interactions is still lacking in functional group-based approaches. Here, we propose a new approach based on an a posteriori clustering of species to quantify the effects of species interactions on ecosystem functioning. We first decompose the observed ecosystem function using null models, in which species diversity does not affect ecosystem function, to separate the effects of species interactions and species composition. This allows the identification of a posteriori functional groups that have contrasting diversity effects on ecosystem functioning. We then develop a formal combinatorial model of species interactions in which an ecosystem is described as a combination of co-occurring functional groups, which we call an assembly motif. Each assembly motif corresponds to a particular biotic environment. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach using datasets from a microbial experiment and the long-term Cedar Creek Biodiversity II experiment. We show that our a posteriori approach is more accurate, more efficient and more parsimonious than a priori approaches. The discrepancy between a priori and a posteriori approaches results from the way each clustering is set up: a priori approaches are based on ecosystem or species properties, such as ecosystem size (number of species or functional groups) or species' functional traits, whereas our a posteriori approach is based only on the observed interaction and composition effects on ecosystem functioning. Our findings demonstrate that an a posteriori approach is highly explanatory: it identifies who interacts with whom, and quantifies the effects of species interactions on ecosystem functioning. They also highlight that a combinatorial modelling of ecosystem functioning can predict the functioning of an ecosystem without any hypothesis about the biotic or environmental determinants or any information on species functional traits. It only requires the species composition of the ecosystem and the observed functioning of others that share the same assembly motif.","[Jaillard, Benoit; Richon, Camille] INRA, Ecol Fonct & Biogeochim Sols & Agrosyst Eco & Sol, Montpellier, France; [Deleporte, Philippe] CIRAD, Ecol Fonct & Biogeochim Sols & Agrosyst Eco & Sol, Montpellier, France; [Loreau, Michel] CNRS, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, Moulis, France; [Loreau, Michel] Paul Sabatier Univ, Moulis, France; [Violle, Cyrille] Univ Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, EPHE, UMR 5175,CEFE,CNRS, Montpellier, France; [Richon, Camille] CEA Orme Merisiers, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Gif Sur Yvette, France","Jaillard, B (corresponding author), INRA, Ecol Fonct & Biogeochim Sols & Agrosyst Eco & Sol, Montpellier, France.","benoit.jaillard@inra.fr",NA,NA,"Effet d'echantillonnage sur la comprehension et la prediction du fonctionnement des ecosystemes (INRA); TULIP Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41]; French Foundation for Research on Biodiversity; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [ERC-StG-2014-639706]","Effet d'echantillonnage sur la comprehension et la prediction du fonctionnement des ecosystemes (INRA); TULIP Laboratory of Excellence, Grant/Award Number: ANR-10-LABX-41; French Foundation for Research on Biodiversity; European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: ERC-StG-2014-639706",NA,35,8,8,0,33,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2041-210X","2041-2096",NA,"METHODS ECOL EVOL","Methods Ecol.

In this study, the analysis of surface water bodies carried out to containing of some heavy metals, such as: Pb, Fe, Mn, Sr, Zn, Cd and Cu, as well as comparison of obtained results with the results of previous research in 2006. During the research it was found that the main heavy metal contaminating town water bodies is cadmium (Cd), which average concentration is thirtyfold higher then allowed statutory level of contaminants for water bodies to amenity needs. Maximal concentration of Cd is 37 MPC an (maximum permissible concentration in water bodies to amenity needs) was evidenced in the pond inside the industrial area. The other heavy metals found in water bodies and benthic sediments in concentrations 2-5 MPC an were Pb, Fe and Mn. The results were compared with the previous research data in 2006, and it should be noticed, that during the eleven years concentrations of Pb and Mn lowered a bit, but they are still higher than MPC an. At the same time, concentrations of Fe and Cd have slightly increased. In regards to heavy metals' concentrations in sediments, their dynamics changed a little. Basing to the obtained data, the specific combinatorial water pollution index (SCWPI) was calculated. This index characterizes water pollution rate, and for water bodies in Dzerzhinsky town SCWPI was 11 points, which indicates that surface waters in the town could be classified as strongly polluted waters.","[Riabova, E.

One application that is not fully explored yet is their use for assessing the species biodiversity and presence of invasive alien species (IAS) in maritime biosecurity. The phylogeographical signals of the mitochondrial COI (mtCOI) gene have been sometimes used to infer the number of introductions and the origin of biological invasions. Here, we employed mtCOI barcodes of mollusks and acorn barnacles (N= 751) from ports of French Polynesia to infer the effect of port size, maritime traffic, and degree of openness in the risk of biological invasions. With 17.2% of non-indigenous species (NIS) recorded here, significant differences in diversity were found among docks and between long-time docked ships and their closest piers. A higher proportion of NIS was found from sheltered compared to open ports regardless of their size and traffic. Less frequent wave washing, a lower effect of currents, and partial isolation in sheltered ports could explain the difference. The results suggest that port biota surveys should focus first on ports sheltered from the open sea and emphasize the value of mtCOI barcodes for the early detection of potential invasive species and for prioritizing surveillance efforts.","[Garcia-Vazquez, Eva; Ardura, Alba] Univ Oviedo, Dept Funct Biol, Oviedo, Spain; [Planes, Serge] Ctr Rech Insulaire & Observ Environm, USR CNRS EPHE 3278, Moorea, French Polynesi, France; [Planes, Serge] Ctr Rech Insulaire & Observ Environm, Lab Excellence CORAIL, Moorea, French Polynesi, France","Garcia-Vazquez, E (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, Dept Funct Biol, Oviedo, Spain.","egv@uniovi.es",NA,NA,"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [MINECO CGL2016-79209-R]; Juan de la Cierva fellowship; IRCP-CRIOBE Grant (2018); Government of Asturias [IDI-2018-00020]","This study was funded from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under the Grant MINECO CGL2016-79209-R and the Government of Asturias Principality under the Grant IDI-2018-00020; 1.

Yet, this is seemingly at odds with substantial evidence that niches tend to be similar among closely related species (i.e. niche conservatism). Identifying the relative importance of these opposing processes in driving niche evolution under different circumstances is therefore essential to our understanding of the interaction between ecological and evolutionary phenomena. In this study, we make use of recent advances in our understanding of the phylogeny of kelps (Laminariales) to investigate niche evolution in one of the most ecologically significant groups of benthic habitat-forming organisms on the planet. We quantify functional traits and use community sampling data from a kelp diversity hotspot to determine which traits are responsible for the habitat (beta) niche of kelps and whether they are labile or conserved across the kelp phylogeny. We find that combinations of functional traits have evolved convergently across kelp subclades and that these functional traits are significant predictors of community structure. Specifically, traits associated with whole-kelp structural reinforcement and material properties were found to be significantly correlated with species distributions along a gradient of wave disturbance and thus predict the outcome of environmental filtering. However, kelp assemblages were made up of species that are more phylogenetically distinct than expected (i.e. phylogenetic overdispersion), suggesting that niche partitioning along this gradient of wave disturbance has been an important driver of divergence between close relatives. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that environmental filtering associated with wave disturbance plays an essential role in determining the habitat niche of kelps across local communities and further suggest that this process can drive phenotypic divergence and niche partitioning between close relatives. We propose that parallel adaptive radiation of kelp subclades has shaped the diversity and species composition of kelp forests in the Northeast Pacific and we discuss how evidence from the literature on incipient or ongoing speciation events supports this hypothesis.

Yet, current methods for recording kill rates of free-ranging predators, particularly those that consume small-bodied (<2 kg) prey, present a number of associated challenges. In this paper, we deployed custom-adapted acoustic recorders and tri-axial accelerometers on free-ranging Canada lynx Lynx canadensis to assess the capacity of biologging devices to continuously document individual hunting behaviour, including prey selection and kill rates, on a predator that specializes on prey weighing Automated classification of acoustic recordings captured 87% of snowshoe hare kills that were identified through snow-tracking (26 of 31 kills). Classification of detailed acceleration recordings summarized over minutes, instead of seconds, captured consumption of snowshoe hare Lepus americanus, but not smaller species, at high accuracy (F1 = 0.96). By summarizing acoustic and accelerometer data from free-ranging lynx, we demonstrate the capacity of these devices to document within- and between-individual variation in diet composition (ranging from 40% to 80% snowshoe hares) and daily feeding bouts (ranging from 0 to 3.5 bouts per day). We suggest that acoustic recorders provide a promising method for characterizing several aspects of predator hunting behaviour including prey selection and chase outcomes, while broad-scale accelerometer-based behavioural classifications provide hare kill rates and fine-scale non-hunting behavioural information. Combined, the two technologies provide a means to remotely document both kills and feeding events of small-bodied prey, allowing for individual-based exploration of functional responses, predator-prey interactions and food web dynamics at temporal scales relevant to environmental change.","[Studd, Emily K.; Boutin, Stan] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Studd, Emily K.; Menzies, Allyson K.; Humphries, Murray M.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ, Canada; [Derbyshire, Rachael E.; Murray, Dennis L.] Trent Univ, Dept Biol, Peterborough, ON, Canada","Studd, EK (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; Studd, EK (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ, Canada.","studd@ualberta.ca","; Boutin, Stan/A-2619-2014","Menzies, Allyson/0000-0003-2280-1880; Derbyshire, Rachael/0000-0002-6672-7996; Boutin, Stan/0000-0001-6317-038X","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); W.

Decomposition of litter is a key biochemical process that regulates the rate and magnitude of CO2 fluxes from biosphere to atmosphere and determines soil nutrient availability. Although several studies have shown that plant litter decomposition accelerated in their native compared to a foreign environment, that is, a home-field advantage (HFA) for litter degradation, to date HFA has only been considered in terms of respiration or litter mass loss. 2. The competitive success of the decomposer micro-organism will be determined by its ability to transform used OM into population growth. Therefore, we hypothesized that HFA for microbial growth would be more pronounced than that for decomposition. We also expected that HFA effect for decomposition and microbial growth would increase with lower quality litter, which the fungal role in litter decomposition would be more dominant than that of bacteria, and that HFA effects would strengthen with more pronounced differences between 'home' and 'away' environments. 3. We designed a 2-month microcosm reciprocal transplant experiment with litter from two sites with contrasting climates (Atlantic and Sub-Mediterranean climates) and including three tree species (Quercus robur, Pinus sylvestris and Fagus sylvatica). 4. We found a stronger HFA for microbial growth than for decomposition, that the nutrient content and C-quality of litter influenced the microbial HFA and that interactions between bacterial and fungal communities during litter decomposition modulated the HFA for litter degradation. 5. Low litter nutrient content, strong nutrient limitations and low C-qualities all favoured fungal over bacterial decomposers, and our results suggest a dominant functional role of the fungal community and gave rise to HFA effect for fungal growth but that this translated to only marginal implications for overall decomposition of litter.","[Benito-Carnero, Garazi; Gartzia-Bengoetxea, Nahia; Arias-Gonzalez, Ander] NEIKER Basque Inst Agr Res & Dev, Dept Forest Sci, Zamudio, Spain; [Rousk, Johannes] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Microbial Ecol, MEMEG, Lund, Sweden","Benito-Carnero, G (corresponding author), NEIKER Basque Inst Agr Res & Dev, Dept Forest Sci, Zamudio, Spain.","garazi.benito@gmail.com","Rousk, Johannes/E-9741-2010","Rousk, Johannes/0000-0002-4985-7262","COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [FP1305]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [2015-04942, 2020-04083]; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [2018-01315]; Knut and Alice Wallenberg FoundationKnut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation [KAW 2017.0171]; INIAInstituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA) [FPI2014-040]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [RTA2012-00048-00-00]; Department of Economic Development and Infrastructure of the Basque Government","COST Action, Grant/Award Number: FP1305; Swedish Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 2015-04942 and 2020-04083; Swedish Research Council Formas, Grant/Award Number: 2018-01315; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, Grant/Award Number: KAW 2017.0171; INIA, Grant/Award Number: FPI2014-040; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Grant/Award Number: RTA2012-00048-00-00; Department of Economic Development and Infrastructure of the Basque Government",NA,61,0,0,39,39,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0269-8463","1365-2435",NA,"FUNCT ECOL","Funct.

However, forest resilience is likely to vary over gradients of topoclimate and vegetation characteristics, and the influences of local climate and tree species on tree regeneration remain key uncertainties in assessing forest recovery from wildfire. We surveyed tree regeneration 9-15 yr post-fire at 397 gridded field plots across four sites at a lower montane forest-steppe ecotone in the eastern Sierra Nevada, California, USA, and then used statistical modeling to characterize how the probability of tree regeneration presence for different species varied along gradients of fire severity, topoclimate, and post-fire vegetation structure and composition. Tree regeneration was absent in half the field plots, and only 19% of plots contained >250 seedlings and saplings per ha, suggesting potential for regeneration failure and forest loss. Tree regeneration composition was consistent with shifts away from Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) and toward drought-tolerant pinyon pine (P. monophylla) and mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius). Tree regeneration was strongly associated with trees that survived fire indicating tree cover is crucial to buffer establishment against climatic stress. Based on projected future water balance, the likelihood of tree regeneration at these sites does not decline substantially by the end of the century. Consequently, these forests appear to be resilient to climate change under a low-severity fire regime, but large patches of high-severity fire are likely to shift vegetation away from forest. Our results highlight the importance of facilitation and future water balance in maintaining semi-arid forest margins that burn at low severity while high-severity fire threatens to convert forest to steppe or invasive grasslands.","[Harris, Lucas B.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, 302 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Taylor, Alan H.] Penn State Univ, Earth & Environm Syst Inst, Dept Geog, 302 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Harris, LB (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, 302 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.","lbh146@psu.edu",NA,NA,"NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1735558]; Center for Landscape Dynamics research award; Ruby S.

Competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal (CSR) theory is a prominent plant functional strategy scheme previously applied to local floras. Globally, the wide geographic and phylogenetic coverage of available values of leaf area (LA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA) (representing, respectively, interspecific variation in plant size and conservative vs. acquisitive resource economics) promises the general application of CSR strategies across biomes, including the tropical forests hosting a large proportion of Earth's diversity. 2. We used trait variation for 3068 tracheophytes (representing 198 families, six continents and 14 biomes) to create a globally calibrated CSR strategy calculator tool and investigate strategy-environment relationships across biomes world-wide. 3. Due to disparity in trait availability globally, co-inertia analysis was used to check correspondence between a 'wide geographic coverage, few traits' data set and a 'restricted coverage, many traits' subset of 371 species for which 14 whole-plant, flowering, seed and leaf traits (including leaf nitrogen content) were available. CSR strategy/environment relationships within biomes were investigated using fourth-corner and RLQ analyses to determine strategy/climate specializations. 4. Strong, significant concordance (RV = 0.597; P < 0.0001) was evident between the 14 trait multivariate space and when only LA, LDMC and SLA were used. 5. Biomes such as tropical moist broadleaf forests exhibited strategy convergence (i.e. clustered around a CS/CSR median; C:S:R = 43: 42: 15%), with CS-selection associated with warm, stable situations (lesser temperature seasonality), with greater annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Other biomes were characterized by strategy divergence: for example, deserts varied between xeromorphic perennials such as Larrea divaricata, classified as S-selected (C: S: R = 1:99:0%) and broadly R-selected annual herbs (e.g. Claytonia perfoliata; R/CR-selected; C:S:R = 21:0:79%). Strategy convergence was evident for several growth habits (e.g. trees) but not others (forbs). 6. The CSR strategies of vascular plants can now be compared quantitatively within and between biomes at the global scale. Through known linkages between underlying leaf traits and growth rates, herbivory and decomposition rates, this method and the strategy-environment relationships it elucidates will help to predict which kinds of species may assemble in response to changes in biogeochemical cycles, climate and land use.","[Pierce, Simon; Luzzaro, Alessandra] Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Environm Sci DiSAA, Via G Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Negreiros, Daniel; Barbosa, Newton P.

While many methods for estimating the ET0 have been developed during the past several decades, method selection essentially depends on the availability of measured climatic variables. The FAO-56PM method recommended by experts from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is widely used in agricultural and environmental research to estimate the ET0. However, it requires several climatic parameters that are not always available in developing countries, especially in arid regions. Here, we compare and evaluate the performance of 13 widely- and commonly-used equations for estimating ET0 against that predicted using the FAO-56PM model using climatic data from nine meteorological stations located in arid regions across Iran. On average, the best three methods that could be used as an alternative to the FAO-56PM equation were the Irmak (Irmak et al., 2003), Hargreaves-Samani (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985), and Hargreaves (1975) equations.","[Nazari, M.] McGill Univ Canada, Dept Plant Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Chaichi, M.

Phosphorus (P) has long been considered the primary limiting element in lowland forests, but recent evidence demonstrates substantial heterogeneity in response to nutrient addition, highlighting a need to understand and diagnose nutrient limitation across diverse forests. Fine-root characteristics including their abundance, functional traits, and mycorrhizal symbionts can be highly responsive to changes in soil nutrients and may help to diagnose nutrient limitation. Here, we document the response of fine roots to long-term nitrogen (N), P, and potassium (K) fertilization in a lowland forest in Panama. Because this experiment has demonstrated that N and K together limit tree growth and P limits fine litter production, we hypothesized that fine roots would also respond to nutrient addition. Specifically we hypothesized that N, P, and K addition would reduce the biomass, diameter, tissue density, and mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots, and increase nutrient concentration in root tissue. Most morphological root traits responded to the single addition of K and the paired addition of N and P, with the greatest response to all three nutrients combined. The addition of N, P, and K together reduced fine-root biomass, length, and tissue density, and increased specific root length, whereas root diameter remained unchanged. Nitrogen addition did not alter root N concentration, but P and K addition increased root P and K concentration, respectively. Mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots declined with N, increased with P, and was unresponsive to K addition. Although plant species composition remains unchanged after 14 years of fertilization, fine-root characteristics responded to N, P, and K addition, providing some of the strongest stand-level responses in this experiment. Multiple soil nutrients regulate fine-root abundance, morphological and chemical traits, and their association with mycorrhizal fungi in a species-rich lowland tropical forest.","[Wurzburger, Nina] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Wright, S.

In arid lands, grassland ecosystems tend to be vulnerable and have been degraded due to the influence of human activities. The total area of the natural grasslands in Xinjiang, a large region in arid north-western China, ranks third in terms of area in China. In the process of grassland degradation, poisonous plants have spread widely and quickly in this region. During recent years, increasing economic losses have been caused by poisonous plants in Xinjiang. Although poisonous plants have been reported at some specific locations, their spatial patterns have rarely been investigated at a large regional scale. To understand the current status of hazards and assess the invasion risks of poisonous plants, we sampled similar to 150 poisonous plant species from Xinjiang and modelled the present and the future (the 2050s and the 2070s) distribution of 90 species using species distribution modelling. Based on the distribution maps of these poisonous plants, four diversity hotspots of poisonous plants were identified in Xinjiang. The results showed that northern Xinjiang had higher levels of poisonous plant diversity compared with the other part of Xinjiang. The precipitation factors had the most influence on prediction of the poisonous plants distributions in the species distribution modelling. Under the scenarios of future climate change, the results of modelling showed that regions close to the four hotspots of poisonous plants in Xinjiang displayed higher risks of invasion by poisonous plants in the future. In addition, these areas with a high risk of plant invasion will become increasingly large. We propose that policy makers consider implementing monitoring and prevention measures in areas identified as having a high risk of future invasion by poisonous plants.","[Zhang, Hong-Xiang; Zhang, Ming-Li; Wang, Yong] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Key Lab Biogeog & Bioresource Arid Land, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ming-Li] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Zhang, ML (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Key Lab Biogeog & Bioresource Arid Land, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.; Zhang, ML (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.","zhanghx561@ms.xjb.ac.cn; zhangml@ibcas.ac.cn",NA,NA,"Young Doctor Science and Technology Talents Training Project of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region [qn2015bs016]","The editors and anonymous referees are acknowledged for their valuable comments that improved the earlier version of this paper.

Nine sites were chosen, including grasslands at different elevations, a bog and a glacier foreland site at the lower alpine zone and a snowbed at the upper alpine zone. Data were acquired by frequency counts in 1 m(2) permanent plots inside each fenced area (three plots per site) and outside in grazed areas (three plots), Diversity indices and functional diversity were analyzed by means of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), Exclosure, duration of exclusion and exclosureyears (interaction effect) were defined as predictor variables, Multivariate ordination techniques were used to (i) determine species responses to grazing exclusion (pRDA, partial redundancy analysis) and (ii) to create a distance matrix representing the changes between exclosures and control plots per year (NMDS, non-metric multidimensional scaling). At the subalpine grassland, first differences between exclosure and control plots occurred already only after three years, at the upper alpine zone after four and five years. Contrary to our expectation, dwarf shrubs did not increase within the exclosures of the subalpine grassland. Instead, mainly the tall forb Geranium sylvaticuin increased. Species richness significantly decreased at the exclosures of the subalpine zone, the snowbed and at one upper alpine grassland sites. The communities of the glacier foreland and the hog were hardly affected by grazing exclusion. We conclude that plant species and communities react individually depending on elevation and grazing animals.

Long-distance avian migrants are known to move with the seasonal dynamics on an annual basis, but how individuals respond to seasonality within their tropical non-breeding range has been less studied. Here we analyse the movement pattern of a highly mobile aerial insectivorous bird, the pallid swift Apus pallidus, and its association with the local habitat phenology during the non-breeding period, using individual-based light-level geolocation. We extracted timing and location of 21 birds' residence periods, as well as characteristics of the intervening movements, such as distance and speed. We used time series of precipitation and vegetation data for each residence area to extract the timing of the local end of the rainy season and the onset of the dry season. The pallid swifts repeatedly upgraded their habitat by undertaking 2-5 intra-tropical migrations correlated with the withdrawal of the rains and the onset of the local dry season. The birds arrived to the sites on average 12 days after rains ended and departed about two weeks after the onset of dry season suggesting that the birds closely tracked a spatiotemporal window presumably timed with optimal foraging conditions. Our results provide insights in the ways Palaearctic-African migrants respond to the asynchronous phenology within their sub-Saharan non-breeding range. We confirmed that pallid swifts actively respond to deteriorating conditions by repeated upgrades in habitat quality, which likely have substantial consequences for an individual's access to an essential, spatiotemporally ephemeral food resource.

To shed light on links between climate and N cycling in tropical forests, we measured bulk surface soil C and N concentrations and isotopic content at 40 forested sites spanning an 1800 m elevation transect in Central America, possessing wide variation in mean annual temperature (MAT; range = 10 degrees C) and precipitation (MAP; range = 1.2 m). Climate and terrain attributes were extracted from gridded data sets and regressed against soil variables, and then, empirical relationships were combined with a mass balance model to scale up to the larger landscape. Across the remote study region, elevation and soil delta N-15 values displayed a strong negative relationship, while elevation was positively related to percent of soil C, N, and C: N ratios. As elevation was tightly correlated with MAT and MAP, soil chemical and isotopic content varied strongly with climate. For example, for every degree increase in MAT, soil delta N-15 values-an indicator of relative gaseous N losses-increased by a factor of 0.4, and soil C: N ratios, which affect net N mineralization and N availability, declined by a factor of 1.1. With the 40 sites binned into bioclimatic life zones, montane, premontane, and wet-premontane transition forests showed distinct clustering of soil chemical and isotopic properties, yet forest type alone explained less variation compared to continuous elevation-climate parameters. Results of the spatially applied N-15 mass balance model implied shifts in the contribution of gaseous-to-total N loss, from 10% or less in cool, wet high-elevation forests to upwards of 60% at warmer, drier, low-elevation sites. Climate variation was thus associated with significant shifts in N dynamics across this montane tropical region, yet more work is needed to decouple direct vs. indirect climatic controls. While the mechanisms deserve further study, observed shifts in indicators of N availability and gaseous loss may be useful in managing and modeling tropical forests under climate change.","[Weintraub, Samantha R.; Cole, Rebecca J.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Schmitt, Carl G.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Mesoscale & Microscale Meteorol Div, Boulder, CO 80301 USA; [All, John D.] Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Geog & Geol, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA; [Weintraub, Samantha R.] Natl Ecol Observ Network, 1685 38th St,100, Boulder, CO 80301 USA; [Cole, Rebecca J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Hilo, HI 96720 USA","Weintraub, SR (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.; Weintraub, SR (corresponding author), Natl Ecol Observ Network, 1685 38th St,100, Boulder, CO 80301 USA.","weintrsr@colorado.edu","Schmitt, Carl G/P-5490-2015","All, John/0000-0002-1401-971X; Schmitt, Carl/0000-0003-3829-6970","ACSP volunteers; NSF Postdoctoral FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF 10-02586]","We thank Marvin Lopez Morales and two indigenous guides for their assistance executing the difficult cross-Talamanca expedition.

The dump preparation involved leveling the technogenic eluvium and its subsequent covering with (1) a 10-cm layer of fertile topsoil (FTS) taken from heaps of soil removed and piled prior to the dump formation or (2) a 10-cm layer of potentially fertile undersoil (PFUS) consisting of loesslike loam from the overburden dump. A flat site on a sandstone dump with a lithogenically undeveloped soil layer without the application of FTS or PFUS was used as the control. The herbal-seed mixture (HSM) was procured in summer and fall in Bachatskie Sopki regional botanical reserve on steppe slopes, whose vegetation is constituted by meadow-steppe plant communities with the predomination of S. capillata. The experimental and control sites were monitored for 5 years, from 2015 to 2019. The variant with loamy undersoil provides the best conditions for the growth and development of S. capillata: some individuals start blossoming as early as in the first year; in the third year, all plants blossom and fruit; and, in the fifth year, the share of S. capillata in the total productivity amounts to 83.6%. The plants form a thick sod layer and successfully compete with weeds. In the variant with FTS, the share of S. capillata was 4-8% in 2015-2018 and reached 30.1% only in 2019. The suppression of S. capillata in this variant is caused by the high competitiveness of the species Elytrigia repens (L.) Nevski, whose rhizomes were brought to the dump together with FTS from the soil heaps. In the control variant, an S. capillata community was noted in the fifth-fourth years; apparently, it originates from seeds dispersed from the experimental variants.","[Kupriyanov, A.

However, theory suggests that native and invasive species occurring in low-resource environments will be functionally similar, as environmental factors restrict the range of observed physiological and morphological trait values. We measured resource-use traits in native and invasive plant species across eight diverse vegetation communities distributed throughout the five mediterranean-climate regions, which are drought prone and increasingly threatened by human activities, including the introduction of exotic species. Traits differed strongly across the five regions. In regions with functional differences between native and invasive species groups, invasive species displayed traits consistent with high resource acquisition; however, these patterns were largely attributable to differences in life form. We found that species invading mediterranean-climate regions were more likely to be annual than perennial: three of the five regions were dominated by native woody species and invasive annuals. These results suggest that trait differences between native and invasive species are context dependent and will vary across vegetation communities. Native and invasive species within annual and perennial groups had similar patterns of carbon assimilation and resource use, which contradicts the widespread idea that invasive species optimize resource acquisition rather than resource conservation.","[Funk, Jennifer L.] Chapman Univ, Schmid Coll Sci & Technol, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Standish, Rachel J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Standish, Rachel J.] Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; [Stock, William D.] Edith Cowan Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Management, Joondalup, WA 6027, Australia; [Valladares, Fernando] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Valladares, Fernando] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Ciencias, Madrid, Spain","Funk, JL (corresponding author), Chapman Univ, Schmid Coll Sci & Technol, Orange, CA 92866 USA.","jlfunk@chapman.edu","Standish, Rachel J/B-1028-2011; Funk, Jennifer/AAX-9325-2021; Funk, Jennifer/AAL-6185-2021","Funk, Jennifer/0000-0002-1916-5513","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OISE-1132994]; Stanford UniversityStanford University; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental DecisionsAustralian Research Council","We thank F.

Pollution is a global issue at the frontier between ecology, environmental science, management, engineering and policy. Legislation requires experiments to determine how much contamination an ecosystem can absorb before there are structural or functional changes. Yet, existing methods cannot realistically simulate regimes of chemical disturbance and determine impacts to assemblages in ecosystems. This is because they lack ecologically relevant species and biotic interactions, are logistically difficult to set up and lack environmentally relevant regimes of chemical and abiotic disturbance that organisms experience in polluted areas. 2. We solved these long-standing environmental, logistical, experimental and ecological problems by developing a programmable dosing system. This dosing system simulates, in situ, regimes of chemical disturbance to assemblages by manipulating the concentration, duration, timing and frequency of pollutants to which they are exposed. 3. Experiments with priority pollutants (the metal copper and the biocide chlorpyrifos) and mussel assemblages revealed consistent plumes of contamination within patches of mussel. Mussels at the sources of experimental plumes of copper created by the dosing system, accumulated 670% more copper in their tissues compared to mussels 0.5-50 m away. In addition, when mussels were exposed to increasing concentrations of copper, there was a concomitant increase in the amount of copper in the tissues of mussels. Combining the dosing system with an established hierarchy of ecotoxicological assays revealed mussel assemblages exposed to copper and/or chlorpyrifos had 40-70% fewer worms, whilst chlorpyrifos alone caused an 81% reduction in the number of amphipods and caused mussels to filter 48% fewer particles from the water. Combinations of copper and/or chlorpyrifos had no effects on the abundance of crabs, the respiratory functions of assemblages or the viability of molluscan haemocytes. 4. As global contamination accelerates, we discuss how this technological advance will enable a diverse array of ecologists, mangers and policy-makers to understand and reduce pollution.","[Browne, Mark Anthony; Brooks, Paul R.; Crowe, Tasman P.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sci Ctr West, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Browne, Mark Anthony; Pinto, Mariana Mayer] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Browne, Mark Anthony; Pinto, Mariana Mayer] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Browne, Mark Anthony] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, 735 State St,Suite 300, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; [Clough, Robert; Fisher, Andrew S.] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Portland Sq, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England","Browne, MA (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sci Ctr West, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland.; Browne, MA (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.; Browne, MA (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.; Browne, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, 735 State St,Suite 300, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA.","m.browne@unsw.edu.au",NA,"Browne, Mark Anthony/0000-0002-7508-1015; Mayer-Pinto, Mariana/0000-0001-9679-7023; Brooks, Paul/0000-0002-8105-0813","Irish Research Councils (IRC-SET, IRCHSS); UCD's Graduate Research Education Programme (GREP) in Sustainable Development; IRCSET Post-Doctoral FellowshipIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology; UCD's GREP on Sustainable Development","Equipment was purchased through funding by Irish Research Councils (IRC-SET, IRCHSS) and UCD's Graduate Research Education Programme (GREP) in Sustainable Development.

Both the strength and direction of natural selection on interacting populations vary with the community context, which itself is changed by these interactions. Here, we test for the role of interacting evolutionary and ecological processes in plant-herbivore interactions during early community succession in the tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima. We use surveys in a large-scale field experiment with repeated plots representing 6 years of early oldfield succession and reciprocal transplant common garden experiments to test for the relative importance of rapid evolution (genetic) and environmental changes (soil quality) in affecting mean plant resistance and growth phenotypes during community succession. While plant growth varied strongly with soil quality over the first 5 years of agricultural abandonment, plant secondary metabolism, and herbivore resistance varied minimally with the soil environment. Instead, mean composition and abundance of plant secondary compound bouquets differed between S. altissima plants from populations collected in communities in the first (early) and sixth (intermediate) years of oldfield succession, which was reflected in the feeding preference of the specialist herbivore, Trirhabda virgata, for early succession lines. Moreover, this preference was most pronounced on poorer quality, early succession soils. Overall, our data demonstrate that plant quality varies for insect herbivores during the course of early succession and this change is a combination of altered genotypic composition of the population and phenotypic plasticity in different soil environments.","[Howard, Mia M.] Cornell Univ, Plant Biol Sect, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Kalske, Aino; Kessler, Andre] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Kessler, A (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.","ak357@cornell.edu",NA,"Kessler, Andre/0000-0002-1797-7518; Howard, Mia/0000-0003-4940-0366; Kalske, Aino/0000-0003-3850-8996","Sustainable Biodiversity Fund grant from the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future; Kone Foundation; Multistate Hatch Grant [NE-1501]; Federal Capacity Funds from Cornell University Agricultural Experiment Station through the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NYC-183855]","We thank Isabella Swyst, Alex Stotter, Anupreksha Jain, and Alex Chauta for their help with field and laboratory work; Drs.

However, only few of them are considered agricultural pests. Life history traits such as high fecundity, fast population growth, and high dispersal ability have been used to characterize agricultural pest insects. However, many other non-pest insects also share these traits, which indicates that there has not been a decisive condition characterizing agricultural pest insects. Agricultural habitats are risky and ephemeral to pests because of pest control and harvesting. The usual arithmetic mean fitness cannot be used to measure the persistence of these pests, because the maximal mean fitness is achieved only when they exhibit no dispersal, but that leads to immediate extinction. Using ageometric mean fitness model, we propose a quantitative measure of long-term reproductive success for agricultural pest insects. By usingthis approach, we can evaluate the trade-off between long-distance dispersal and high reproduction correctly and estimate the condition for the long-term persistence of pest insects in agricultural habitats.

Additionally, it is possible that the effects of locally adapted microorganisms on individual plant species could be altered by co-occurring plant species. We tested these possibilities in plant community mesocosms with soils and mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) from three locations. We found that plant community biomass responded positively to local adaptation of AMF to soil conditions. Plant community composition also changed in response to local adaptation of AMF. Unexpectedly, the strongest benefits of locally adapted AMF went to early successional plant species that have the highest relative growth rates and the lowest responsiveness to the presence of AMF. Late successional plants that responded positively overall to the presence of AMF were often suppressed in communities with local AMF, perhaps because of strong competition from fast growing plant species. These results show that local adaptation of soil microbial communities can shape plant community composition, and the benefits that plants derive from locally adapted microorganisms can be reshaped by the competitive context in which these associations occur.","[Bauer, Jonathan T.] Miami Univ, Dept Biol, 700 E High St, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Bauer, Jonathan T.] Miami Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, 250 S Patterson Ave, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Koziol, Liz; Bever, James D.] Kansas Biol Survey, 2101 Constant Ave, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; [Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1200 Sunnyside Ave, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Bauer, JT (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Biol, 700 E High St, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.; Bauer, JT (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, 250 S Patterson Ave, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.","bauerjt@miamioh.edu","Koziol, Liz/AAX-5972-2020",NA,"Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program grant [RC-2330]; National Science Foundation grantsNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1556664, 1656006]; United States Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture Grant [2016-67012-24680]","This work was supported by Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program grant RC-2330 and National Science Foundation grants 1556664 and 1656006 to JDB and United States Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture Grant 2016-67012-24680 to JTB.

Movement is crucial in metapopulation ecology because it facilitates colonization and reduces the likelihood of local extinction via rescue effects. Most metapopulation modeling approaches describe connectivity using pair-wise Euclidean distances resulting in the simplifying assumption of a symmetric connectivity pattern. Yet, assuming symmetric connectivity when populations show net asymmetric movement patterns may result in biased estimates of colonization and extinction, and may alter interpretations of the dynamics and conclusions regarding the viability of metapopulations. Here, we use a 10-year time series on a wind-dispersed orchid Lepanthes rupestris that anchors its roots in patches of moss growing on trees or boulders along streams, to test for the role of connectivity asymmetries in explaining the colonization-extinction dynamics of this orchid in a network of 975 patches. We expected that wind direction could highly alter dispersal direction in this orchid. To account for this potential asymmetry, we modified the connectivity measure traditionally used in metapopulation models to allow for asymmetric effective distances between patches and subsequently estimated colonization and extinction probabilities using a dynamic occupancy modeling approach. Asymmetric movement was prevalent in the L. rupestris metapopulation and incorporating potential dispersal asymmetries resulted in higher colonization estimates in larger patches and more accurate models. Accounting for dispersal asymmetries may reveal connectivity effects where they were previously assumed to be negligible and may provide more reliable conclusions regarding the role of connectivity in patch dynamics.","[Acevedo, Miguel A.] Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Acevedo, Miguel A.; Fletcher, Robert J., Jr.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Tremblay, Raymond L.] Univ Puerto Rico Humacao, Dept Biol, Humacao, PR 00792 USA; [Melendez-Ackerman, Elvia J.] Univ Puerto Rico Rio Piedras, Dept Environm Sci, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Tremblay, Raymond L.; Melendez-Ackerman, Elvia J.] Univ Puerto Rico, Ctr Appl Trop Ecol & Conservat, San Juan, PR 00931 USA","Acevedo, M (corresponding author), Sch Nat Resources & Environm, POB 110430, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.","miguel.acevedo7@upr.edu","Tremblay, Raymond L/Q-3763-2019","Tremblay, Raymond L/0000-0002-8588-4372","National Science Foundation (NSF) Quantitative Spatial Ecology, Evolution and Environment Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship Program at the University of Florida [0801544]; NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1110441]; School of Natural Resources and Environment; Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation at the University of Florida; Center for Applied Tropical Ecology and Conservation [NSF-HRD 0734826]","This work greatly benefited from discussions with B.

The presence of source patches, however, may facilitate persistence of species-supersaturation in the face of invaders. We explore that notion here through simulation analyses of more detailed spatially explicit models depicting one- and two-dimensional systems (pipe and two-eddy models, respectively) where water circulation is governed over a range of advection and turbulent diffusion. For the pipe model, when advection and turbulent diffusion are low, and when advection is high and turbulent diffusion is low, resident assemblages are more resistant to invaders. But at intermediate rates of advection and with increases to turbulent diffusion, assemblages are more quickly impacted by invaders. For the two-eddy model, when advection and turbulent diffusion are low, resident assemblages are again resistant to invaders, but only for lumpy assemblages. In contrast to the pipe model, resistance to invaders of neutral and lumpy assemblages is high when advection and turbulent diffusion are high. For both model configurations, intransitive assemblages were much more sensitive to invaders, suggesting that intransitivity might not be as prevalent a biodiversity-sustaining mechanism in spatially heterogeneous plankton systems.

Trophic mismatches occur when phenological responses to environmental conditions differ among trophic levels such that the timing of resource demand by consumers becomes decoupled from supply. We used 25 years of demographic measurements of a migratory songbird (the black-throated blue warbler Setophaga caerulescens) to compare its breeding phenology to the phenology of both its caterpillar prey and the foliage on which caterpillars feed. Caterpillar biomass in this forest did not show a predictable seasonal pulse. Nest initiation by warblers in this northern hardwood forest was therefore not timed to coincide with a peak in food availability for nestlings. Nonetheless, timing of first clutches was strongly associated with spring leaf expansion (slope +/- SE = 0.56 +/- 0.08 days per day of change in leaf phenology, R-2 = 0.66). Warblers adjusted the timing of breeding to early springs mainly by shortening the interval between arrival and clutch initiation, but this likely has limits because recent early springs are approaching the relatively inflexible dates when birds arrive on the breeding grounds. Although the timing of first nests did not match 1:1 with leaf-out phenology, the adjustments in breeding time maximized mean annual reproductive success. Nest predation had the greatest effect on annual reproductive success, but the ability of nesting warblers to appropriately track leaf phenology accounted for effects on annual reproductive success comparable to the influence of variation in caterpillar abundance and conspecific density. Nesting phenology in black-throated blue warblers was generally well matched to the timing of leaf-out, even though the match was not 1:1. Without measurements of reproductive success, these unequal phenological shifts might otherwise have been interpreted as having negative ecological consequences.","[Lany, Nina K.; Ayres, Matthew P.; Holmes, Richard T.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, 78 Coll St,Class 1978 Life Sci Ctr, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Stange, Erik E.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-2624 Lillehammer, Norway; [Sillett, T.

More than 50% of the global human population lives in urban settings, which, for urban agglomerations with > 1 million inhabitants, span a 30 degrees C range in mean annual temperature and 4000 mm annual precipitation range. 2. Although the biodiversity impacts of urbanization are most commonly investigated at the assemblage level, these impacts are mediated through organismal physiology and behaviour. 3. At the individual level, mechanistic models, which provide an explicit means to understand how organisms meet the requirements of heat, water and nutrient balance, offer a useful way to assess physiological and behavioural responses to urban environments and their consequences for population dynamics. 4. Physiological determinants of assemblage variation can usefully be investigated by examining entry, exit and transformation rules. These are biases in the processes that determine which individuals join or leave a population or assemblage, and processes that act on individuals, which remain part thereof. 5. Direct evidence for physiological adaptation (broadly construed as phenotypic plasticity, genotypic change or some interaction between them) to urban environments is remarkably limited, owing largely to low numbers of investigations, given that most studies that have been conducted reveal some form of adaptation. 6. A warming tolerance approach, applied to insects globally, demonstrates that transposing sampled populations to the nearest urban area reduces warming tolerance by several degrees, though this effect is on average more marked for the Southern than the Northern Hemisphere. The lowest warming tolerance is found between 30 and 35 degrees N or S, suggesting that in the absence of mitigation, the urban heat island effect of cities here will have the most pronounced impacts on insect populations. 7.

Effective conservation of northern fur seals depends on understanding the foraging behavior of adult females whose foraging success is linked to pup survival. We determined the foraging behavior for 11 tagged lactating female northern fur seals from the Pribilof Islands using a state-space modeling approach with an autoregressive movement model. To interpret at-sea behavior in the context of oceanic habitat, we spatially and temporally matched high-resolution reconstructed tracks to a set of environmental covariates that included: commercial groundfish catch, sea surface temperature, primary productivity, wind speed, depth and time of day. We used a Bayesian hierarchical framework to implement a multinomial regression model to link behavior to environmental covariates and account for the mismatch of scale between fur seal behavior and the environmental variables by incorporating an error-in- covariates approach into the hierarchical model. The Bayesian framework allowed us to build a single model to synthesize the information from all the northern fur seal foraging tracks and the available information about the underlying environmental conditions. Application of the approach indicated that the behavioral states for the northern fur seal were significantly related to the Alaska commercial groundfish catch, particularly walleye pollock (Gadus chalogramma).","[Joy, Ruth; Routledge, Richard D.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Dowd, Michael G.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Battaile, Brian C.; Lestenkof, Pamela M.; Trites, Andrew W.] Univ British Columbia, Marine Mammal Res Unit, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Sterling, Jeremy T.] Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Mammal Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","Joy, R (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.","rutherfordjoy@gmail.com",NA,"Trites, Andrew/0000-0003-0342-5322","NSERC Canadian Graduate ScholarshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Tula Foundation Research Scholarship; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); North Pacific Universities Marine Mammal Research consortium; North Pacific Research Board","R.

These new selection pressures can be accommodated by different mechanisms that act on different levels and across different time scales: (1) By changing transcriptomic profiles, species can react by plasticity within individual physiological limitations. (2) Invasive populations can adapt by fixing beneficial genetic variants in response to the newly encountered selection pressures. Here, we compare the genomic and transcriptomic landscapes of two independent invasions of the Pacific Oyster (Crassostrea gigas) into the North Sea. In detail, we combine ddRAD sequencing on the genomic level with RNAseq on the transcriptomic level to reveal outlier loci (SNPs) indicative of adaptation, as well as transcriptomic profiles from a translocation experiment to show immediate physiological reactions between two populations characterizing the two independent invasions. Generally, we found low physical congruence between differentially regulated genes and outlier loci, indicating that different genes are involved on the different time scales. Functionally matching outlier loci and differentially expressed genes were however found for spliceosomal modification of mRNA and particularly for transposon activation, indicating that these variation creating processes might be connected across eco-physiological and evolutionary time scales. By contrasting and identifying functional congruence between population outlier loci and population specific transcriptomic profiles, we can thus reveal a glimpse at the traits and processes characterizing specific mechanisms involved in successful invasions.","[Wegner, K.

The structure of these networks is usually characterised by calculating one or more indices that capture different aspects of network architecture. While these indices capture useful properties of networks, they are relatively insensitive to changes in network structure. Consequently, variation in ecologically-important interactions can be missed. Network motifs are a way to characterise network structure that is substantially more sensitive to changes in pairwise interactions and is gaining in popularity. However, there is no software available in R, the most popular programming language among ecologists, for conducting motif analyses in bipartite networks. Similarly, no mathematical formalisation of bipartite motifs has been developed. Here we introduce bmotif: a package for motif analyses of bipartite networks. Our code is primarily an r package, but we also provide matlab and Python code of the core functionality. The software is based on a mathematical framework where, for the first time, we derive formal expressions for motif frequencies and the frequencies with which species occur in different positions within motifs. This framework means that analyses with bmotif are fast, making motif methods compatible with the permutational approaches often used in network studies, such as null model analyses. We describe the package and demonstrate how it can be used to conduct ecological analyses, using two examples of plant-pollinator networks. We first use motifs to examine the assembly and disassembly of an Arctic plant-pollinator community and then use them to compare the roles of native and introduced plant species in an unrestored site in Mauritius. bmotif will enable motif analyses of a wide range of bipartite ecological networks, allowing future research to characterise these complex networks without discarding important meso-scale structural detail.","[Simmons, Benno, I; Sweering, Michelle J.

There is mixed evidence from a limited number of studies, however, regarding how predator presence influences settlement of coral-reef fishes and it is unknown how other potentially mediating factors, including predator origin (native vs. nonnative) or interactions among con-specific recruits, mediate the non-consumptive effects of predators on reef fish settlement. During a field experiment in the Caribbean, approximately 52% fewer mahogany snapper (Lutjanus mahogoni) recruited to reefs with a native predator (graysby grouper, Cephalopholis cruentata) than to predator-free control reefs and reefs with an invasive predator (red lionfish, Pterois volitans) regardless of predator diet. These results suggest that snapper recruits do not recognize nonnative lionfish as a threat. However, these effects depended on the density of conspecific recruits, with evidence that competition may limit the response of snapper to even native predators at the highest recruit densities. In contrast, there was no effect of predator presence or conspecific density on the recruitment of bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus). These context-dependent responses of coral- reef fishes to predators during settlement may influence individual survival and shape subsequent population and community dynamics.","[Benkwitt, Cassandra E.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Benkwitt, CE (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.","benkwitc@science.oregonstate.edu",NA,"Benkwitt, Cassandra/0000-0001-6756-7958","National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); American Fisheries Society Steven Berkeley Marine Conservation Fellowship; Oregon State University Research Grants; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-12-33027]","Funding was provided by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship, American Fisheries Society Steven Berkeley Marine Conservation Fellowship, Oregon State University Research Grants, and Sigma Xi Grant-in-Aid of Research awarded to the author, and NSF grant OCE-12-33027 awarded to M.A. Hixon.

We aimed here to identify variation in tree species composition throughout the Ngovayang Massif (southern Cameroon) and determine the relative contributions of environmental factors and spatial autocorrelation in shaping tree species composition. Vegetation surveys were conducted in fifteen 1-ha (100 m x 100 m) permanent plots established along a transect from lowland (200 m) to submontane forests (900 m) in which all trees with a diameter (dbh) >= 10 cm were inventoried. Data were investigated using ordination methods (Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis). At the local scale, the most important variable in determining tree species composition patterns was slope exposure, followed by distance from the ocean and altitude. Together, these environmental variables explained 28% of floristic variation among plots, and the spatial structure almost disappeared when the effects of these variables were removed. Spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that spatial variables (geographic coordinates of the plots) or geographic distance between plots explained only 1% of the total initial variance. Residual spatial variation not explained by the environmental variables probably reflects the history of vegetation and the effects of other climatic variables that were not included in this study. Floristic variation in the Ngovayang Massif is due to strong environmental heterogeneity. The sensitivity of floristic composition to environmental variables such as slope orientation and altitude suggests that tree species composition may shift with expected climate changes, such as changes in the movement of air masses, increase in mean annual temperatures or increasing severity of the dry season. Our study highlights the need for systematic on-the-ground measurements of climate variables in tropical montane areas in order to better understand the current climate regime and serve as a basis for modelling future changes.","[Gonmadje, Christelle] Univ Yaounde I, Dept Plant Biol, POB 812, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Gonmadje, Christelle; Doumenge, Charles] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Forets & Soc, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Sunderland, Terry] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, POB 0113, Bobcd Bogor 16000, Indonesia; [Sunderland, Terry] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [McKey, Doyle] CNRS 5175, UMR, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France","Gonmadje, C (corresponding author), Univ Yaounde I, Dept Plant Biol, POB 812, Yaounde, Cameroon.","cgonmadje@yahoo.fr","Sunderland, Terence/AAE-7851-2019","Sunderland, Terence/0000-0002-1985-9849","French Ministry of Foreign Affairs [374]; Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement (CIRAD); Service de Cooperation et d'Action Culturelle (SCAC) of the French Embassy in Cameroon","We thank 'Sud Expert Plantes' (SEP No 374, a programme funded by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs), the Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement (CIRAD), and the Service de Cooperation et d'Action Culturelle (SCAC) of the French Embassy in Cameroon for financial assistance through research grants that made this study possible.

However, great uncertainties exist for the CO2 fertilisation effects, particularly when its interactions with other global change factors are considered. A four-factor (CO2, temperature, precipitation and nitrogen) experiment revealed that elevated CO2 did not affect either gross ecosystem productivity or ecosystem respiration, and consequently resulted in no changes of net ecosystem productivity in a semi-arid grassland despite whether temperature, precipitation and nitrogen were elevated or not. The observations could be primarily attributable to the offset of ecosystem carbon uptake by enhanced soil carbon release under CO2 enrichment. Our findings indicate that arid and semi-arid ecosystems may not be sensitive to CO2 enrichment as previously expected and highlight the urgent need to incorporate this mechanism into most IPCC carbon-cycle models for convincing projection of terrestrial carbon sink and its feedback to climate change.","[Song, Jian; Wan, Shiqiang; Liu, Yinzhan; Zhong, Mingxing; Zheng, Mengmei; Ma, Gaigai; Zhou, Zhenxing; Ru, Jingyi] Henan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Int Joint Res Lab Global Change Ecol, Kaifeng 475004, Henan, Peoples R China; [Song, Jian; Wan, Shiqiang] Hebei Univ, Coll Life Sci, Baoding 071002, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sinofrench Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Earth Sci, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Hui, Dafeng] Tennessee State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37209 USA; [Hovenden, Mark J.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Biol Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Ciais, Philippe] UVSQ, CNRS, CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Liu, Yongwen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Wan, SQ (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Int Joint Res Lab Global Change Ecol, Kaifeng 475004, Henan, Peoples R China.; Wan, SQ (corresponding author), Hebei Univ, Coll Life Sci, Baoding 071002, Hebei, Peoples R China.","swan@ibcas.ac.cn","Ciais, Philippe M/A-6840-2011; 周, 振兴/X-2681-2019; Liu, Yinzhan/AAC-2391-2021; Wan, Shiqiang/L-9166-2019; Zhou, Zhenxing/ABA-2159-2020; Wan, Shiqiang/B-5799-2009; Liu, Yongwen/O-7330-2015","Ciais, Philippe M/0000-0001-8560-4943; Zhou, Zhenxing/0000-0001-9208-0893; Wan, Shiqiang/0000-0003-0631-1232; Liu, Yongwen/0000-0002-9664-303X; Hui, Dafeng/0000-0002-5284-2897","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31430015, 31830012, 41030104/D0308]","The authors thank Juanjuan Han for her constructive suggestions in improving the manuscript, Haijun Yang, Tingjuan Wu, Qian Zhang, Pengshuai Shao, Fanglong Su, Yuan Miao, Hongyan Han, Ang Zhang, Tong Zhang, Jiajia Wang, Jiajia Zhang, and Guoyong Li for their help in the experiment construction and data measurements, and the staff at the Duolun Restoration Ecology Research Station, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for their help in maintaining the field facilities.

Standardized protocols are urgently needed, alongside a better understanding of how different methods and recorders (data collectors) influence estimates of pollinator abundance and diversity. We compared two common methods for sampling wild pollinating insects (solitary bees, bumblebees and hoverflies), pan traps and transects, in surveys of 1 km countryside squares (agricultural and semi-natural habitats) and flowering crop fields across Great Britain, including the influence of local floral resources (nectar sugar availability or crop flower density) on the insects sampled. Further, we compared the performance of recorders with differing expertise (non-specialist research staff, taxonomic experts and non-expert volunteers) in applying methods. Pan traps and transects produced compositionally distinct samples of pollinator communities. In the wider countryside, pan traps sampled more species of solitary bee and hoverfly. In flowering crops, transects recorded a greater number of individual bumblebees, but fewer species. Across all taxonomic groups and countryside and crop samples, transects generally had lower rates of species accumulation per individual collected than pan traps. This demonstrates that differences between methods in estimating richness are not due to sampling effort alone. However, recorders possessing greater taxonomic expertise can produce species accumulation data from transects that are almost commensurate with pan trapping. The abundance and species richness of pollinators (except solitary bees) on transects in the wider countryside was positively related to the availability of estimated nectar sugar. In crops, pollinator abundance responses to flower densities were idiosyncratic according to crop type, but overall the response was positive and negative for transects and pan traps, respectively. Given these taxonomic and context-specific differences in method performance, we assess their suitability for monitoring pollinating insect communities and pollination services. We discuss the relevance of these findings within the context of achieving standardized, large-scale monitoring of pollinating insects.","[O'Connor, Rory S.; Garratt, Michael P.

Over 55 different food items were identified from the analysis of 387 scat samples collected during the dry and wet seasons. In the coffee forest habitat, African civets showed omnivorous feeding habit with plant-to-animal diet biomass ratio of 1:1.36. A slight diet specialization was observed during the wet season (BA=0.46) favouring animal prey. However, during the dry season, they showed generalist feeding habit (BA=0.87) with more plant biomass in their diet. With over 64% occurrence and 14.4% biomass, coffee berries significantly contributed to the civets dry season plant diets. The excreted coffee beans, after civets ingested ripe coffee berries, are the tastiest product used by farmers for consumption and market.

We identify individuals through DNA samples collected by (1) biopsy darting mountain lions detected in systematic surveys of the study area, (2) opportunistically collecting hair and scat samples, and (3) sampling all harvested mountain lions. We included 80 DNA samples collected from 62 individuals in the analysis. Including information on predicted habitat use as a covariate on the distribution of activity centers reduced the median estimated density by 44%, the standard deviation by 7%, and the width of 95% credible intervals by 10% as compared to standard SCR models. Within the two management units of interest, we estimated a median mountain lion density of 4.5 mountain lions/100 km 2 (95% CI = 2.9, 7.7) and 5.2 mountain lions/100 km(2) (95% CI = 3.4, 9.1). Including harvested individuals (dead recovery) did not create a significant bias in the detection process by introducing individuals that could not be detected after removal. However, the dead recovery component of the model did have a substantial effect on results by increasing sample size. The ability to account for heterogeneity in habitat use provides a useful extension to SCR models, and will enhance the ability of wildlife managers to reliably and economically estimate density of wildlife populations, particularly large carnivores.","[Proffitt, K.

I tested the hypothesis that successional changes in vegetation structure, which affected invertebrate abundance, would influence growth rates and body condition in the early-successional, insectivorous gecko Nephrurus stellatus. I captured geckos at 17 woodland sites spanning a succession gradient from 2 to 48 years post-fire. Body condition and growth rates were analysed as a function of the best-fitting fire-related predictor (invertebrate abundance or time since fire) with different combinations of the co-variates age, sex and location. Body condition in the whole population was positively affected by increasing invertebrate abundance and, in the adult population, this effect was most pronounced for females. There was strong support for a decline in growth rates in weight with time since fire. The results suggest that increased early-successional invertebrate abundance has filtered through to a higher trophic level with physiological benefits for insectivorous geckos. I integrated the new findings about trophic interactions into a general conceptual model of mechanisms underlying post-fire population dynamics based on a long-term research programme. The model highlights how greater food availability during early succession could drive rapid population growth by contributing to previously reported enhanced reproduction and dispersal. This study provides a framework to understand links between ecological and physiological traits underlying post-fire population dynamics.","[Smith, Annabel L.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland","Smith, AL (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland.","annabel@smithecology.org","Smith, Annabel L./M-6391-2014","Smith, Annabel L./0000-0002-1201-8713","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP0776604]; Native Vegetation Council of South Australia; DEWNR; Wildlife Conservation Fund; Sir Mark Mitchell Research Foundation; Lirabenda Endowment Fund; Ecological Society of Australia; Australian National UniversityAustralian National University","This paper is dedicated to the memory of Professor C.

We present here an overview of the state of the art on RS techniques for mapping and monitoring Mediterranean wetlands, and the remaining challenges: delineating and separating wetland habitat types; mapping water dynamics inside wetlands; and detecting actual wetland trends over time in a context of high, natural variability.

Understanding habitat preference of a targeted wildlife species is crucial for developing effective conservation strategies. Habitat preference of large grazers in connection to grass height and post-fire effect has been debated for the last century. Here, we examined the effects of season, grass height and burning on the habitat preference on Swayne's hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus swaynei) in Maze National Park. Data for seasonal habitat selection were collected using both direct observation along established transect lines and pellet counting using permanently established plots. Every month, we measured grass height commonly preferred by Swayne's hartebeest in grassland habitat. Starting from the first week of burning, we recorded the abundance of Swayne's hartebeest in both burned and unburned grassland patches. Results From detected pellets, 94.3% were recorded in the grassland habitat indicating that other habitat types are less used despite their extensive cover > 50% of the Park. During wet and early dry seasons, Swayne's hartebeest exclusively preferred grassland habitat. We found that 85.2% (n = 1079) and 85.3% (n = 593) of individuals observed in areas with a grass height below 30 cm during wet and early-dry seasons, respectively; while 70.9% (n = 2288) preferred grass height below 30 cm during the dry season. The density of Swayne's hartebeest in burned grassland area was higher than unburned grassland areas up to 150 days since burning. However, in unburned grassland areas, the density was initially low but showed increasing trend for consecutive days, reaching similar density with burned areas after 150 days since burning. Conclusion Swayne's hartebeest exclusively preferred grassland habitat, particularly during wet and early-dry seasons, shortest available grass height in all seasons and were attracted to burned grassland areas. Our results suggested that fire played an important role in maintaining habitat quality in grassland, and that management should continue using controlled burning as a tool for the conservation of Swayne's hartebeest. However, we remain cautious of our findings given the paucity of information regarding other confounding factors and the absence of long-term data on fire disturbance.","[Tamrat, Misganaw; Stenseth, Nils Chr.] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, POB 1066, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Tamrat, Misganaw; Atickem, Anagaw; Bekele, Afework] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Zool Sci, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Tsegaye, Diress] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, POB 1066, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Tsegaye, Diress] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway; [Evangelista, Paul] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, B254 NESB, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA","Tamrat, M (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, POB 1066, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.","tamratm15@gmail.com",NA,NA,"Rufford Small Grant for Nature Conservation [24529-2]; Addis Ababa Uni-versity [TR-010 CNCS]","Rufford (24529-2) Small Grant for Nature Conservation and Addis Ababa Uni-versity (TR-010 CNCS) thematic research project funded this study.

Using three-block partial least squares regression, we present a procedure to quantify and define bi-variance and tri-variance of data blocks related to plant communities, their soil parameters, and topography. Bi-variance indicates the total amount of covariation between these three domains taken in pairs, whereas tri-variance refers to the common variance shared by all domains. We characterized relationships among three domains (plant communities, soil properties, topography) for a salt marsh, four coastal dunes, and two temperate forests spanning several regions in the world. We defined the specific bi- and tri-variances for the ecological systems we included in this study and addressed larger questions about how these variances scale with each other looking at generalities across systems. We show that a system tends to exhibit high bi-variance and tri-variance (tight coupling among domains) when subjected to the effects of frequent and widespread (i.e., broadly acting) hydrogeomorphic disturbance. When major disturbance events are uncommon, bi-variance and tri-variance decrease, because the formation of vegetation, soil, and topographic patterns is primarily localized, and the couplings of these properties diverge over space, contingent upon site-specific disturbance history and/or fine-grained environmental heterogeneity. We also demonstrate that the bi-variance and tri-variance of a whole system are not consistently either greater or smaller than those of the associated sub-zones. This point implies that the overall correlation structure among vegetation, soil, and topography is conserved across spatial scales. This paper addresses a critical aspect of ecology: the conceptual and analytical integration of data across multiple domains. By example, we show that bi-variances and tri-variances provide useful insight into how the strength of couplings among vegetation, soil, and topography data blocks varies across scales and disturbance regimes. Though we describe the simplest case of multi-variance beyond the usual two-block linear statistical model, this approach can be extended to any number of data domains, making integration tractable and more supportive of holistic inferences.","[Kim, Daehyun; Stallins, J.

In this study climatogenic changes in forest growing conditions are examined in the Northern Caspian region, taking into account that the functioning of forest stands is limited on historically treeless lands: authomorphic meliorated solonetz soils and calcisoles (by the extra moisture of winter snowfalls and the humidity levels during the vegetational period), as well as intrazonal hydromorphic gleyic kastanozems of the local relief depressions (by the inexhaustibility of freshwater lenses in salty subterranean waters based on its periodic resupply by the spring surface flow every 2-4 years). For forest stands established on automorphic soils, a prolonged period of annual draughts and mild winters with little snow deposit in forest lands has proven to be the most dangerous. During such periods, the large-scale death of trees is observed and many forest stands are ruined. For forest stands on hydromorphic soils, such periods prove to be just as dangerous because of the 15-year-long absence of spring surface flow. Such a climatogenic scenario of long-termed deterioration of forest growing conditions in the Northern Caspian region is similar to the southernmost regions of Russia that are currently totally unable to sustain forests, with unstable snow cover and frequent draughts.","[Sapanov, M.

However, there have been few comparisons of the effectiveness of different types of field-margin pollinator habitat in maintaining bee diversity and pollination of the focal crops. We compared wild bee abundance, species richness and community composition between strawberry crops bordered by hedgerows, and those bordered by larger expanses of natural land (forests). Strawberry is an ideal crop in which to investigate pollinator export from field margins as the rows are covered with straw, which reduces habitat for ground-nesting bees within the crop; thus, most wild pollinators need to enter the crop from the margins. We sampled bees in six strawberry fields with hedgerow margins and six strawberry fields with forested margins of at least 200 m in length, using a paired design. We examined strawberry pollen deposition at regular intervals into the fields, and the magnitude of pollinator export from the field margins towards the centre of the crops. We found that bees as a group were no more species-rich or abundant in crops bordered by forests than in crops bordered by hedgerows, although large-bodied bees were more abundant in the former than the latter. Regardless of field-margin type, we found that small wild bee abundance declined significantly from the edge to the centre of the crop, but honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) and large-bodied bee abundance did not. Strawberry pollen deposition also did not decline with distance into the crop. Although previous work indicates that small wild bees are more effective (yield-increasing) pollinators of strawberry on a per-visit basis, their limited foraging ranges suggest they may only pollinate areas near the crop margins, given typical field sizes in our area.

However, understanding which antipredator mechanisms are lost through relaxed selection, and how they influence the ability of prey to respond to novel predatory threats, is limited. The varying effects on native lizard populations of the relatively recent and patchy history of mammalian introductions to New Zealand's islands provide an opportunity to examine the consequences of relaxed selection. We assess behavioural patterns and predator detection abilities of native lizards, using chemicals of native reptilian and introduced rodent predators as cues. Focal lizard populations were isolated from predatory mammals for up to 16 million years; some now co-occur with mammals, while others remain in mammal-free locations. A skink species that evolved with mammals and has recently been introduced to New Zealand is included for comparison. Lizard behavioural patterns were correlated with recent and historical experience of mammals. Lizards always isolated from mammals exhibited the most antipredator freeze behaviour, whereas one that coevolved with mammals exhibited greatest activity (movements). However, predator chemical cues did not induce specific antipredator responses in any species indicating that these behavioural patterns are not linked to chemosensory predator detection alone.","[Monks, Joanne M.; Nelson, Nicola J.; Daugherty, Charles H.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Brunton, Dianne H.] Massey Univ, Inst Nat & Math Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Shine, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Monks, Joanne M.] Dept Conservat, Biodivers Grp, POB 5244, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Shine, Richard] Macquarie Univ, Sch Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW, Australia","Monks, JM (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand.; Monks, JM (corresponding author), Dept Conservat, Biodivers Grp, POB 5244, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.","jmonks@doc.govt.nz",NA,NA,"Foundation for Research, Science TechnologyNew Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology; Society for Research on Amphibians and Reptiles in New Zealand; Zoological Society of San Diego; Ngati Koata; Te Atiawa; Ngati Toa iwi","We thank Peter Martin, Richard Romijn, Rhys Mills, Jo Peace, Grant Timlin, James Allen and Jen Moore for assistance.

The literature describes the use of the multisubstrate testing system (MTS) Ecolog for the solution of environmental problems. It is based on triphenyltetrazolium bromide, which has proven itself in assessing the negative consequences in the environment due to industrial and domestic pollution. In environmental studies, the viability of microorganisms and their communities is estimated in terms of the intensity of the restoration of tetrazolium salts, but the authors themselves note that MTS Ecolog does not register the response of the entire microbial community. In connection with this, the purpose of the work was to search for an additional factor for the use of tetrazolium salts, namely, transport them into the cell. The identification of the role of diffusion in the cellular formation of formazanes plays an important role in increasing the objectivity of research results, including ecological ones, with the participation of tetrazolium salts. Using the kinetic methods, the role of passive diffusion in the reduction of iodnitrotetrazolium (INT) by cells of gramnegative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli is shown. Applying the integral method of determining the general order, it is found that the reduction of INT by cell components of bacteria Ps. aeruginosa, suspended in physiological solution, is satisfactorily described by linear anamorphosis of the first order kinetics. It has been established that the reduction of iodnitrotetrazolium chloride by the cellular components of bacteria depends on the structure and chemical composition of the cell wall and biomembranes of bacteria and is controlled by the diffusion of the reagent into the cell. The linear dependence of the initial rate of reduction of INT from its initial concentration was revealed, which for biological objects involving cells is a sign of passive diffusion. A low temperature sensitivity of the reduction reaction of the INT is detected in the temperature range, which does not significantly exceed the optimum temperature for Ps. aeruginosa of 37 degrees C.","[Kalinina, A.

CRUSTACEA; ENVIRONMENTAL-STRESS; CHEMICAL CUES; SETTLEMENT BEHAVIOR; BARNACLE SETTLEMENT; RISK; LARVAE; POPULATIONS; ECOLOGY; DENSITY","Predator chemical cues can elicit behavioral changes in prey to minimize predation risk. Recent field studies have shown that such predator nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) can ultimately affect prey demography. The environment is known to modulate predator consumptive effects on prey demography, but the environmental modulation of predator NCEs on prey demography remains unstudied. We investigated this knowledge gap using an intertidal predator-prey system. Dogwhelk (Nucella lapillus) chemical cues can limit barnacle (Semibalanus balanoides) recruitment by limiting larval settlement. As waves disperse chemicals in coastal environments, we experimentally tested the hypothesis that wave exposure limits dogwhelk NCEs on barnacle recruitment. Shortly before the barnacle recruitment season of 2013 (May-June), we established cages in rocky intertidal habitats in Atlantic Canada under two levels of wave exposure. The cages were used to manipulate the presence and absence of dogwhelks. At the center of each cage, we installed a tile where barnacle pelagic larvae could settle and develop into recruits. Mesh prevented caged dogwhelks from accessing the tiles, but allowed their waterborne cues to reach the tiles. Data collected at the end of the recruitment season indicated that dogwhelk cues limited barnacle recruitment in wave-sheltered habitats but had no effect on recruitment in wave-exposed habitats. These findings suggest that predicting predator NCEs on prey demography may require environmental information related to the ability of prey to locate predators.","[Ellrich, Julius A.; Scrosati, Ricardo A.] St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, 2320 Notre Dame Ave, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada","Scrosati, RA (corresponding author), St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, 2320 Notre Dame Ave, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada.","rscrosat@stfx.ca","Scrosati, Ricardo A/K-6172-2016","Scrosati, Ricardo A/0000-0002-3050-132X; Ellrich, Julius/0000-0003-0884-3726","Canada Research Chairs Program (CRC)Canada Research ChairsAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme; Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI)Canada Foundation for Innovation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","We thank Katharina Romoth, Lorena Arribas, and Willy Petzold for field assistance, David Risk, Steven MacDonald, and Vince Arsenault for laboratory assistance, and Markus Molis, Russell Wyeth, and an anonymous reviewer for constructive comments.

Because of their worldwide distribution, we focused on the common pillbug Armadillidium vulgare (Latreille, 1804) (Isopoda, Armadillidiidae), and the common millipede species Rossiulus kessleri (Lohmander, 1927) (Julida, Julidae). The function of environment creation by the given saprophages, as destructors of dead plant matter, supporting such ecosystem services as soil fertility improvement and nutrients' turnover, is highlighted. To conduct the experiment, the animals were collected manually and using pitfall trapping. In order to bring the experimental conditions closer to the natural, the individuals were not sexed. The maximum consumption of leaf litter by woodlice was recorded in the conditions with adequate moisture (0.5 mL of distilled water per box) and amounted to 2.52 mg/10 individuals per day, which exceeds its consumption with low and increased moisture, respectively, by 1.82 and 1.24 times. As for the effect of interaction, the consumption of maple litter with optimal moisture (4.77 mg/10 individuals per day) was the greatest. The largest absolute difference between broad-leaved tree species in the average weight of leaf litter consumed by woodlice was between maple leaf litter and oak leaf litter, the minimum - between robinia leaf litter and oak leaf litter. According to the results of the obtained data (Diplopoda), it can be stated that there is a statistically significant effect of chemical stress and discrepancy of the average zinc content in the object of study (in Diplopoda and their faecal pellets). We found that the diet provided did not affect the distribution of zinc in Diplopoda under conditions of chemical stress. According to the results of pairwise comparisons, we determined that the zinc content in the Diplopoda clearly differs for control and almost every concentration of zinc sulfate solution - 0.03 and 0.15 g/L, the samples of which do not form a homogeneous group. The species composition, abundance and distribution in space of soil invertebrates are informative indicators which reflect the ecological state of soils, intensity in development of soil horizons as well as intensity of processes occurring in them.","[Pokhylenko, A.

Therefore, it is crucial to assess the relative importance of deterministic vs. stochastic factors producing remnant vegetation to understand their function in the persistence of fire-sensitive plants. Vegetation remnants (areas within the landscape that have not burned for a considerable amount of time) may occur stochastically or in more predictable locations (fire refuges) where physical conditions decrease fire severity. Our aim was to determine if remnant forests of the fire-sensitive conifer Austrocedrus chilensis are associated with biophysical attributes that allow persistence in a fire-prone Patagonian landscape. We conducted a multi-scale approach, determining attributes of forest remnants and their surroundings (matrices) through remote sensing and field-based biophysical and functional characteristics, and quantifying how tree survival probability relates to microsite conditions. Trees within remnants displayed abundant fire scars, were twofold older and had threefold larger growth rates than matrix trees. Remnants were associated with high rocky cover and elevated topographical positions. Tree survival increased in hilltops, eastern aspects, and with sparse vegetation. Trees within remnants experienced severe reductions in growth during droughts. Our results suggest that A. chilensis remnants are mainly the result of refuges, where environmental conditions increase fire survival, but also increase susceptibility to drought. A trade-off between fire survival and drought vulnerability may imply that under increasing drought and fire severity, locations that in the past have served as refuges may reduce their ability to allow the persistence of fire-sensitive taxa.","[Landesmann, Jennifer B.; Gowda, Juan H.; Kitzberger, Thomas] Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Lab Ecotono, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Garibaldi, Lucas A.] UNRN, CONICET, Sede Andina, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Landesmann, JB (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Lab Ecotono, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.","jennifer.landesmann@gmail.com","Garibaldi, Lucas A/D-7302-2013; Gowda, Juan/ABE-6184-2020; Kitzberger, Thomas/H-9209-2015","Gowda, Juan/0000-0001-5481-3793; Kitzberger, Thomas/0000-0002-9754-4121; Garibaldi, Lucas Alejandro/0000-0003-0725-4049","Ministerio de Agricultura, Ganaderia y Pesca [BIRF 7520, PIA 10058, PIA 12055]; CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)","We thank Juan Manuel Morales for insightful comments on the manuscript and Maria Laura Suarez for her help in the tree chronology and correlation function analysis.

Snake venoms, in particular, have evolved a wide diversity of peptides and proteins that induce harmful inflammatory and neurotoxic effects including severe pain and paralysis, hemotoxic effects, such as hemorrhage and coagulopathy, and cytotoxic/myotoxic effects, such as inflammation and necrosis. If untreated, many envenomings result in death or severe morbidity in humans and, despite advances in management, snakebite remains a major public health problem, particularly in developing countries. Consequently, the World Health Organization recently recognized snakebite as a neglected tropical disease that affects similar to 2.7 million p.a. The major protein classes found in snake venoms are phospholipases, metalloproteases, serine proteases, and three-finger peptides. The mechanisms of action and pharmacological properties of many snake venom toxins have been elucidated, revealing a complex multifunctional cocktail that can act synergistically to rapidly immobilize prey and deter predators. However, despite these advances many snake toxins remain to be structurally and pharmacologically characterized. In this review, the multifunctional features of the peptides and proteins found in snake venoms, as well as their evolutionary histories, are discussed with the view to identifying novel modes of action and improving snakebite treatments.","[Ferraz, Camila R.; Lewis, Richard J.; Cardoso, Fernanda C.] Univ Queensland, Inst Mol Biosci, Ctr Pain Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Ferraz, Camila R.] Univ Estadual Londrina, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Dept Ciencias Patol, Londrina, Brazil; [Arrahman, Arif; Xie, Chunfang; Kool, Jeroen] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Mol Med & Syst, Div BioAnalyt Chem, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Casewell, Nicholas R.] Univ Liverpool Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Ctr Snakebite Res & Intervent, Liverpool, Merseyside, England","Cardoso, FC (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Inst Mol Biosci, Ctr Pain Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.","f.caldascardoso@uq.edu.au","Lewis, Richard/E-8674-2013","Lewis, Richard/0000-0003-3470-923X","Australian National Health and Medical Research CouncilNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [APP1119056]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [200517/Z/16/Z]; Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission [200517/Z/16/Z]","Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (APP1119056) provided a Fellowship to RL; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) provided an international scholarship to CF; Sir Henry Dale Fellowship to NC (200517/Z/16/Z) funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society.",NA,197,32,33,1,9,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2296-701X",NA,NA,"FRONT ECOL EVOL","Front.

We compared cultivated, restored, and wild populations of Pascopyrum smithii (western wheatgrass) in a greenhouse study to test the extent to which cultivars outcompete local plants in biomass production, and to determine if morphological differences (including height and number of leaves) among cultivated and wild populations persist at restoration sites over time. We found evidence of vigor and greater competitive ability of cultivars in seed mass, growth rate, plant height, and biomass and this advantage occurred when plants were grown alone or in competition with other seed sources.

A small number of hyperdiverse genera comprise a large portion of tree diversity in tropical forests. These closely related congeners are likely to share natural enemies. Diverse defenses could still allow congeners to partition niche space defined by natural enemies, but interspecific differences in defenses would have to exceed intraspecific variation in defenses. We ask whether interspecific variation in secondary chemistry exceeds intraspecific variation for species from four hyperdiverse tropical tree genera. We used novel methods to quantify chemical structural similarity for all compounds present in methanol extracts of leaf tissue. We sought to maximize intraspecific variation by selecting conspecific leaves from different ontogenetic stages (expanding immature vs. fully hardened mature), different light environments (deep under-story shade vs. large forest gaps), and different seasons (dry vs. wet). Chemical structural similarity differed with ontogeny, light environment, and season, but interspecific differences including those among congeneric species were much larger. Our results suggest that species differences in secondary chemistry are large relative to within-species variation, perhaps sufficiently large to permit niche segregation among congeneric tree species based on chemical defenses.","[Sedio, Brian E.; Wright, S.

We tested the hypothesis that an initial shrub encroachment leads to enhanced habitat heterogeneity and thereby to a higher diversity. In a calcareous grassland near Gottingen (Germany) we analysed the effect of shrub encroachment on the species richness in 30, 100 m(2) plots each with 10 subplots of 1m(2) size. The 30 main plots belonged to six different shrub encroachment classes. A descriptive correlative gradient analysis of shrub invaded grasslands and their species number of flowering plants was performed. Within the 30 plots of different shrub encroachment a total of 203 plant species were recorded. The mean alpha 1-diversity (level of subplots), mean alpha 2-diversity (level of plots) as well as the alpha 3-diversity (level of shrub encroachment classes) have their highest values at medium shrub invaded sites. This finding is in line with our hypothesis of a hump-back relation between shrub encroachment and species richness, and can be explained by the increased habitat heterogeneity. However, Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) emphasized the importance of the present vegetation composition for species richness. The dominance of highly competitive, clonal-growing grass species is accompanied by low diversity swards with a lower facilitation of shrub establishment. Species accumulation curves highlight the benefit of shrub encroachment for gamma-(landscape-) diversity. This result emphasises the importance of habitat heterogeneity for biodiversity and, therefore, nature conservation.","[Kesting, S.; Petersen, U.; Isselstein, J.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Von Siebold Str 8, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Kesting, S.] Saxon State Off Environm Agr & Geol, Dept Plant Prod, D-08543 Pohl, Germany; [Petersen, U.] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst Climate Smart Ag, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany","Petersen, U (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Von Siebold Str 8, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany.","Petersen@gmx.net",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,40,10,10,1,34,"AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT","BUDAPEST","BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY","1585-8553","1588-2756",NA,"COMMUNITY ECOL","Community Ecol.","DEC",2015,"16","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"189","195",NA,"10.1556/168.2015.16.2.6",NA,NA,7,"Ecology","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","DC7VP","WOS:000369429000006",NA,"Green Accepted",NA,NA,"2021-09-23",NA

However, there is opposing evidence on whether the secondary compounds of non-native plant species are stronger than those of natives. This may be explained by other factors, besides plant origin, that affect the potential of plant secondary compounds. We tested how plant origin, phylogeny, growth strategy and stoichiometry affected the allelopathic potential of 34 aquatic plants. The allelopathic potential was quantified using bioassays with the cyanobacterium Dolichospermum flos-aquae. The allelopathic potential showed a strong phylogenetic signal, but was similar for native and non-native species. Growth strategy was important, and emergent plants had twice the allelopathic potential as compared to submerged plants. Furthermore, the allelopathic potential was positively correlated to the foliar carbon-to-phosphorus (C:P) and total phenolic content. We conclude that eudicot plant species with an emergent growth strategy and high plant C:P ratio exhibit a high allelopathic potential. Unless non-native plant species match this profile, they generally have a similar allelopathic potential as natives.","[Grutters, Bart M.

In order to improve the modeling of the contaminant concentrations, it is proposed to first process the data using the Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method from HI-IT to obtain a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) which can then be modeled separately using either autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models expanded with a seasonal term, or linear regression analysis, depending on the nature of the IMF. Three priority contaminants measured at Niagara-on-the-Lakes are selected for this study. It is found that the trend of fluoranthene concentrations from April of 1986 to March of 1997 is decreasing and then beginning to increase; the 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene concentrations are decreasing; while the dieldrin concentrations are decreasing. With HHT, appropriate time series models can be identified and constructed for the studied contaminant concentrations to better illustrate the variability of each IMF (and thus the contaminant concentrations) for the studied period. For all data sets modeled in this study, pre-processing the data with HHT allowed for higher R-2 values, correlation coefficients and lower sum of squared errors when compared to modeling without HHT. It is thus confirmed that pre-processing the data with HHT and modeling with time series analysis will provide a more effective means of the studied data sets when identifying and analyzing the trends and variability of studied contaminant concentrations in the Niagara River.","[Tsai, Christina W.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan; [Treadwell, Huntington] SUNY Buffalo, Civil Struct & Environm Engn, 207 Jarvis Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Tsai, Christina W.] SUNY Buffalo, Civil Struct & Environm Engn, 223 Jarvis Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA","Tsai, CW (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.","cwstsai@ntu.edu.tw; hrt@buffalo.edu",NA,"Tsai, Christina/0000-0003-2309-6335","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-0748787]","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from National Science Foundation under grant contract number EAR-0748787.

The data were collected on the 16 sampling plots (500 m(2)), in the Swiss stone pine and Norway spruce forests. We measured the diameter at breast height (dbh) of each tree and recorded the young trees and shrubs. In order to compare species composition between silicate and calcicolous P. cembra forests, we made 91 releves in their entire range of distribution (917 ha). Furthermore, we examined the share of main tree species along the altitude and inclination gradients, using the GAM models. The tree density in the P. cembra forests reaches 618 stems per ha, whereas their basal area (BA) 23.17 m(2) ha(-1). Main tree species are P. cembra and P abies. P. cembra dominates in the higher thickness classes. The BA and dbh structure varies significantly between P. cembra and P. abies forests. The most abundant juveniles are P. abies and Sorbus aucuparia. The differences between forests growing on different substrate are relatively low. The altitude has a significant impact on the share of P. cembra (increase) and P. abies (decrease).

Within this framework, it is suggested that governments and regions should maintain a certain ratio of the area of permanent grasslands to the total Utilized Agricultural Area according to the greening rules of the reform. However, the weak economic performance of permanent grasslands does not encourage farmers to invest into their conservation. This fact persuaded us to revisit our old unpublished data, obtained by experiments on the use of chemical fertilizers in permanent grasslands. By this reanalysis we hope to further support the new European policy with the perspective to find a trade-off between the conservation of the biodiversity and the economic productivity of permanent grasslands. Of the many possibilities we have chosen to present the results of two experiments, one in Italy and the other in Slovakia. The main reason for this choice was that these two studies followed complementary strategies of fertilization that appeared useful to detect both the single and the synergistic effects of N, P, and K on the relationships between yield and species diversity. The results of cluster and diversity analysis suggest that chemical fertilization should be carefully planned according to soil conditions, since different treatments may have the same effect on the floristic and vegetation patterns of grasslands. These results, according to similarity theory, allow to choose the least expensive and polluting combination of N, P and K from those that, according to the species combinations, are assigned to the same cluster.","[Kizekova, M.] Natl Agr & Food Ctr, Grassland & Mt Agr Res Inst, Mladeznicka 36, Banska Bystrica 97421, Slovakia; [Feoli, E.] Univ Trieste, Dept Life Sci, Via A Valerio 10, I-34100 Trieste, Italy; [Parente, G.] European Grassland Federat, Via Adamello 27, I-33078 San Vito Al Taglto, Pordenone, Italy; [Kanianska, R.] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Nat Sci, Tajovskeho 40, Banska Bystrica 97401, Slovakia","Feoli, E (corresponding author), Univ Trieste, Dept Life Sci, Via A Valerio 10, I-34100 Trieste, Italy.","feoli@units.it","Kanianska, Radoslava/A-9325-2019; Kizekova, Miriam/P-5232-2019","Kanianska, Radoslava/0000-0003-1729-8846; Kizekova, Miriam/0000-0003-3025-6704",NA,NA,NA,56,2,2,0,10,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1585-8553","1588-2756",NA,"COMMUNITY ECOL","Community Ecol.","DEC",2017,"18","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"295","304",NA,"10.1556/168.2017.18.3.8",NA,NA,10,"Ecology","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","FV9BY","WOS:000424882900008",NA,"Green Accepted",NA,NA,"2021-09-23",NA

From May 2016 to April 2017, along 7 km of Cape Arago, Oregon, USA surf-zone phytoplankton concentrations were determined weekly at nine sites with varying surf-zone hydrodynamics as indicated by surf-zone widths. Throughout the year, concentrations of phytoplankton in wider, more dissipative surf zones were, on average, 16x higher than in narrow, more reflective surf zones. Similar to previous observations, surf-zone width explained >90% of the variability in phytoplankton concentrations in the surf-zone. On average, similar to 83% of B. glandula had egg lamellae at more dissipative shores compared to only 8% at more reflective. An index of potential reproductive output by barnacle populations as measured by ash free dry mass (AFDM) of egg lamellae was similar to 243x larger at more dissipative than at reflective shores and surf-zone phytoplankton concentrations and surf-zone width explained similar to 96 and 92% of the variability in this index. On average, density of M. californianus was similar to 2x higher at more reflective shores, but 60% of these individuals were smaller and non-reproductive compared to only 24% at the more dissipative sites. The gonad tissue mass/m(2) of medium sized mussels was similar to 5x greater at more dissipative than reflective shores. Surf-zone phytoplankton concentrations and surf-zone width explained similar to 80% and 65% of the variability in individual mussel gonad mass and similar to 69% and 56% of the variability in mussel population gonad mass, respectively. M. californianus were out-planted to assess growth rates and, after 5 months, average body mass was similar to 3x greater at more dissipative than reflective shores. Surf-zone phytoplankton concentrations and width explained similar to 85% and 92% of the mass increase, respectively. Phytoplankton subsidies varied with surf-zone hydrodynamics altering the growth and reproductive output of two ecologically important intertidal filter feeders.","[Salant, Carlissa D.; Shanks, Alan L.] Univ Oregon, Oregon Inst Marine Biol, POB 5389, Charleston, OR 97420 USA","Salant, CD (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Oregon Inst Marine Biol, POB 5389, Charleston, OR 97420 USA.","csalant@uoregon.edu",NA,NA,"NSF-Biological OceanographyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [OCE-1259603, OCE-092735]; Lerner-Gray Fund for Marine Research; Oregon Society of Conchology","This research was supported by NSF-Biological Oceanography OCE-1259603 to R.
