Salix sachalinensis was by far the most preferred host plant of feeding adults, while both S. miyabeana and S. integra were rarely fed upon. The fact that most oviposition was observed on S. sachalinensis also suggested that P. versicolora preferred S. sachalinensis to other willows for oviposition. This adult preference did not correspond well to patterns of larval performance on the three willow species in the absence of enemies. Higher survivorship, shorter developmental time and larger adult size were achieved on S. sachalinensis and S. miyabeana than on S. integra. Performance as indicated by female adult size and development time on S. miyabeana were higher than on S. sachalinensis. In the presence of enemies, however, the survivorship of first-instar larvae on S. miyabeana was much lower than on other willows. Adults of P. versicolora apparently avoided S. miyabeana as an oviposition and feeding host and preferred S. sachalinensis as an enemy-free space. This was not because larvae had poorer performance on S. miyabeana, but because predation pressure on eggs and early instar larvae was more severe on S. miyabeana.","[Ishihara, Michihiro; Ohgushi, Takayuki] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Ishihara, Michihiro] Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Naka Ku, Sakai, Osaka 5998531, Japan","Ishihara, M (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.",mishiha@b.s.osakafu-u.ac.jp,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,67,13,14,0,22,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",1438-3896,1438-390X,NA,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

However, few Australian studies have been undertaken which specifically address the effects of commercial management regimes on rice field biodiversity. In this study, we compared aquatic macroinvertebrate communities within Australian rice fields cultivated under three commercial management regimes: conventional-aerial (agrochemicals applied, aerially sown), conventional-drill (agrochemicals applied, directly drill-sown) and organic-drill (agrochemical-free, directly drill-sown). These comparisons were undertaken using a combination of community assessment approaches, including morphospecies richness, abundance, diversity and community composition. In general, greater biodiversity existed within macroinvertebrate communities that developed under organic management regimes than under conventional regimes (i.e., higher morphospecies richness and Shannon diversity). Although there were significant differences in several parameters across management regimes early in the rice-growing season, as the growing season progressed the invertebrate communities that developed in the different management regimes became more similar. Only community composition analyses showed significant differences late in the growing season, with functional differences across aquatic faunal assemblages suggested by increased predator abundance in communities sampled from the organic management regime. In order to improve biodiversity within these aquatic environments, management techniques need to be examined individually and the most disruptive processes identified. Alternative management procedures can then be developed that minimise biodiversity loss whilst still delivering required agronomic outcomes.","[Wilson, A. L.; Watts, R.

However, delineating and mapping hotspots is subjective and various approaches can lead to different conclusions with regard to the classification of particular areas as hotspots, complicating long-term conservation planning. We present a comparative analysis of recent approaches for identifying waterbird hotspots, with the goal of developing insights about the appropriate use of these methods. We selected four commonly used measures to identify persistent areas of high use: kernel density estimation, Getis-Ord G(i)*, hotspot persistence and hotspots conditional on presence, which represent the range of quantitative hotspot estimation approaches used in waterbird analyses. We applied each of the methods to aerial survey waterbird count data collected in the Great Lakes from 2012-2014. For each approach, we identified areas of high use for seven species/species groups and then compared the results across all methods and to mean effort-corrected counts. Our results indicate that formal hotspot analysis frameworks do not always lead to the same conclusions. The kernel density and Getis-Ord G(i)* methods yielded the most similar results across all species analysed and were generally correlated with mean effort-corrected count data. We found that these two models can differ substantially from the hotspot persistence and hotspots conditional on presence estimation approaches, which were not consistently similar to one another. The hotspot persistence approach differed most significantly from the other methods but is the only method to explicitly account for temporal variation. We recommend considering the ecological question and scale of conservation or management activities prior to designing survey methodologies. Deciding the appropriate definition and scale for analysis is critical for interpretation of hotspot analysis results as is inclusion of important covariates. Combining hotspot analysis methods using an integrative approach, either within a single analysis or post hoc, could lead to greater consistency in the identification of waterbird hotspots.","[Sussman, Allison L.; Zipkin, Elise F.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Coll Nat Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Sussman, Allison L.; Zipkin, Elise F.] Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Gardner, Beth; Adams, Evan M.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Adams, Evan M.; Williams, Kathryn A.] Biodivers Res Inst, Portland, ME USA; [Salas, Leo] Point Blue Conservat Sci, Petaluma, CA USA; [Kenow, Kevin P.] US Geol Survey, Upper Midwest Environm Sci Ctr, La Crosse, WI USA; [Luukkonen, David R.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Monfils, Michael J.] Michigan State Univ Extens, Michigan Nat Features Inventory, Lansing, MI USA; [Mueller, William P.] Western Great Lakes Bird & Bat Observ, Port Washington, WI USA; [Leduc-Lapierre, Michele] Great Lakes Commiss, Ann Arbor, MI USA","Sussman, AL (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Coll Nat Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.; Sussman, AL (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",sussman7@msu.edu,NA,"Zipkin, Elise/0000-0003-4155-6139; Adams, Evan/0000-0002-4327-6926; Kenow, Kevin/0000-0002-3062-5197",U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act grants program,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act grants program,NA,58,3,3,3,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,NA,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

While such aggregates are difficult to study in the field, models of aggregation offer researchers a way to investigate how the interplay of individual behaviour makes aggregation possible and leads to different aggregate-level behaviour. This paper reviews the findings of models of aggregation, both mathematical and computer-based, with a focus on the means used to validate these models. In the context of this review it is argued that the existing de facto modelling framework, the Attraction Repulsion (AR) framework, does not allow for an adequate representation of the properties of individuals required to create validatable models of natural aggregation. However, it is further argued that the increasing use of information or perceptual fields in AR models provides a promising direction for future research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Males and females of this species showed opposite changes of body mass and body condition during the dry and the wet season. Male body mass declined during the dry season that coincides with mating, while female body mass remained constant, During the wet season that coincides with lactation, female body mass declined but male body mass increased. This indicates that changes in body mass are not linked as much to environmental seasonality as to mating and reproduction. The distribution of L. ruficaudatus was most significantly related to the spatial distribution of leaf protein during the wet season. Neither the availability nor the chemical composition of leaves eaten during the dry season affected the spatial distribution of L. ruficaudatus. These findings are consistent with hypotheses that constraints are most severe during the times of lactation and weaning and that distributions of primates reflect their food requirements in order to optimize their reproductive success. They are inconsistent with the idea that the lean dry season is the most stressful time of year for lemurs in energetic or nutritive terms.","Univ Hamburg, Inst Zool, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; Univ Hamburg, Zool Museum, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany","Ganzhorn, JU (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Zool, Martin Luther King Pl 3, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",ganzhorn@zoologie.uni-hamburg.de,"Ganzhorn, Joerg/AAO-6955-2020","Ganzhorn, Joerg/0000-0003-1395-9758",NA,NA,NA,63,84,89,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,NA,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2002,131,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,427,435,NA,10.1007/s00442-002-0891-y,NA,NA,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,557YH,WOS:000175936300013,28547715,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

Our study contrasts the effectiveness, in terms of power and type I error rates, of the Mantel test and PROTEST. We illustrate the application of Procrustes superimposition to visually examine the concordance of observations for each dimension separately and how to conduct hypothesis testing in which the association between two data sets is tested while controlling for the variation related to other sources of data. Our simulation results show that PROTEST is as powerful or more powerful than the Mantel test for detecting matrix association under a variety of possible scenarios. As a result of the increased power of PROTEST and the ability to assess the match for individual observations (not available with the Mantel test), biologists now have an additional and powerful analytical tool to study ecological and evolutionary relationships.","Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada","Peres-Neto, PR (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, 25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",NA,"Jackson, Donald A/J-6441-2013","Jackson, Donald A/0000-0002-6107-0753; Peres Neto, Pedro/0000-0002-5629-8067",NA,NA,NA,43,588,599,3,108,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,NA,NA,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,2001,129,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,169,178,NA,10.1007/s004420100720,NA,NA,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,486TY,WOS:000171834100002,28547594,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

In order to test the hypotheses that species with marked protection in the fruit have high nitrogen concentration ([N]) in the seeds, and species with marked protection in the seeds have high [N] in the embryo-cum-endosperm fraction (EE), we determined the [N] in the seeds and EE of 194 species from lowland tropical rainforest in NE Queensland. For species in which the fruit provides marked protection of the seed there is a significant negative linear relationship between N and log seed mass. There is a similar relationship for 'unprotected' species, but the intercept on the y-axis is significantly and markedly higher for the group of 'protected' species. This relationship holds true when genera rather than species are considered We are also able to make taxonomically controlled comparisons within six families and within four genera: all six familial comparisons and two of the generic comparisons support the finding for the collection of species as a whole.

We analyzed understory vegetation using an approach that combined plant functional types and vertical stratification to evaluate the effects of human disturbances on the ecological integrity of sugar maple-dominated stands in southern Quebec. Ecological integrity was evaluated by analyzing the divergence of understory species assemblages from those observed in comparable unmanaged forest. Multivariate analyses of biological traits revealed 13 emergent groups that share common traits associated with a similar life history strategy. Responses of these groups, of specific traits, and of understory structure to different human disturbances were tested. Nine of the 13 emergent groups varied in occurrence or diversity among disturbance types. Analyses also revealed a set of traits specifically associated with unmanaged old growth forest, indicating that species possessing these traits may be sensitive to human disturbance. Overall, the understory vegetation assemblage was found to be relatively stable among all human disturbances investigated. However, our results suggest some issues of possible long-term conservation concern given a continuation of human disturbances: (i) an increase of species associated with open environment, including exotic species; (ii) a decrease of spring geophytes; (iii) a decrease of certain shade-tolerant forbs; and (iv) a modification of understory structure by the development of a dense sapling stratum.","Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, UMR 7179, F-91800 Brunoy, France; Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, Ctr Etud Foret, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Aubin, I (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, 4101 Rue Sherbrooke Est, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada.",iaubin@sympatico.ca,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,89,53,53,3,43,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1195-6860,2376-7626,NA,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,NA,2007,14,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,259,271,NA,10.2980/1195-6860(2007)14[259:HRANHF]2.0.CO;2,NA,NA,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,182EO,WOS:000247488100015,NA,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

The trophic network model was derived from an Ecopath application made for a shallow water area (Palude delta Rosa), situated in the northern part of the Lagoon of Venice. The organisms-specific output data from the energy model, such as metabolic rates, diet composition and structural characteristics were used as input to the ecotoxicological food chain model. The toxic substance model estimated bioaccumulation (pg/g lipid) of dioxins (e.g. 2378-TCDD, 12378-PeCDD, 123478-HxCDD, 123789-HxCDD, 1234678-HpCDD and 12346789-OCDD) and dibenzofurans (e.g. 2378-TCDF, 12378-PeCDF, 123478-HxCDF, 123678-HxCDF, 123789-HxCDF, 234678-HxCDF, 1234678-HpCDF, 1234789-HpCDF and 12346789-OCDF) for all groups in the trophic network. A sensitivity analysis showed that the toxic concentration in the aquatic species was highly affected by the following parameters: K-ow, fraction of organic carbon in the sediment, lipid fraction, and fraction of unassimilated food. The coupling of the two models was validated with data from four sites in the Lagoon (two in the industrial zone, and two in the southern basin). Calibration and comparisons with measured data were conducted for a clam (Tapes phillppinarum), a mussel (Mytilus edulis) and a fish (Scardinius eritrophtalamus). Model output showed that the discrepancy between chemical analysis and model estimations were in the range of one order of magnitude for T. philippinarum and M. edulis (except for tetra- and penta-furans, where the overestimation reached two order of magnitude). It was also shown that more monitoring efforts should be made on fish species, to have a set of data useful for the validation of the model. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Plants that emerged in June commenced sexual reproduction from late July, and thereafter both vegetative growth and sexual reproduction occurred together until early November, the plants showing no switching from vegetative growth to sexual reproduction. Seedlings that emerged in June and July suffered high mortality, but most seedlings that emerged from August onward survived until the reproductive stage. The minimum size for reproduction was largest for plants that emerged early in file season, and it decreased with a delay in seedling emergence. The late emergence of seedlings that resulted in low reproductive output may be to some extent compensated for by the increased probability of survival in the seedling stage. A transplant experiment clarified that C. maculata call repeat a maximum of three overlapping generations within a year. Multiple generations per year were attained by non-dormant seeds produced in the first and second generations and clearly resulted in an increased reproductive output per year. The life cycle with multiple overlapping generations may have been acquired in habitats where unpredictable disturbance results in temporally unsuitable conditions for germination. vegetative growth and sexual reproduction of annual plants, but where suitable conditions frequently continue over a period longer than the single generation time of annual plants.","Saga Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Appl Biol Sci, Saga 8408502, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan","Suzuki, N (corresponding author), Saga Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Appl Biol Sci, 1 Honjo, Saga 8408502, Japan.",suzukin@cc.saga-u.ac.jp,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,55,9,9,0,10,SPRINGER TOKYO,TOKYO,"3-3-13, HONGO, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0033, JAPAN",0912-3814,NA,NA,ECOL RES,Ecol.

While the relationship between any two of these traits that influence net photosynthetic rate is constrained to some degree, there is sufficient flexibility to allow the evolution of different but more or less equally effective interrelationships among these central elements of leaf form and function. We use contemporary techniques of structural equation modelling to describe the general nature of such evolutionary diversification in leaf form and function among these wetland plants. Our model essentially extends the Cowan-Farquhar model of stomatal regulation to include relationships between SLM and foliar nitrogen. The model can take two forms, with variables expressed as either per unit leaf area or per unit leaf mass. When variables are expressed on an areal basis, the model predicts that a species with a higher SLM will have a higher foliar nitrogen level. The foliar nitrogen level, in accordance with the Cowan-Farquhar model, in turn determines the dynamics of stomatal regulation in relation to the marginal cost of water loss relative to carbon gain. The dependence of stomatal regulation on foliar nitrogen also determines the maximal rates of stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis. Internal CO2 concentrations within the leaf follow as a necessary consequence of these interrelationships. This areal-based model describes the data for the 35 C-3 wetland species well; the same basic model applies to the five C-4 Species in our sample, except for shifts in the quantitative effects of net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance on internal CO2 levels. When the variables are expressed on a mass basis, a slightly different model results, as net photosynthetic rate decreases directly with SLM and is not related to species level variation in either leaf nitrogen concentration or maximal stomatal conductance. Both forms of the model indicate the need to advance our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary basis for variation in SLM, including its association with traits such as leaf demography and canopy architecture as well as environmental characteristics of the habitats where particular species predominate.","Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada","Shipley, B (corresponding author), Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.",bshipley@courrier.usherb.ca; Martin@Biol.lan.mcgill.ca,"Shipley, Bill/A-4578-2011; Lechowicz, Martin/Y-7211-2019","Shipley, Bill/0000-0002-7026-3880;",NA,NA,NA,36,45,50,4,29,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1195-6860,2376-7626,NA,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,NA,2000,7,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,183,194,NA,10.1080/11956860.2000.11682587,NA,NA,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,324FE,WOS:000087610500009,NA,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

The existence of inducible or constitutive (permanent) defences is expected to temper the lethal effects of fish on tadpoles. According to current theories on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, the amphibian species that occur in habitats that are mostly or often fish-free were expected to display inducible defences, while the species that reproduce mainly in fish ponds ought to present constitutive defences. The tested species were Rana dalmatina, Hyla arborea and R. ridibunda, respectively. As expected, R. ridibunda tadpoles were less vulnerable to fish predation than the other species. Nevertheless, all three species exhibited morphological responses in the presence of fish. Their increases in tail area and decreases in body depth were similar. However, behaviour was only modified in R. dalmatina, which exhibited lower activity rates and higher refuge use in the presence of fish cues. Such lower activity rates were related to lower growth and developmental rates. While not detected in this experiment, the existence of inducible defences in the three species suggests the existence of costs of antipredator defence. Those costs may have delayed effects so that increasing the frequency of fish ponds may exacerbate the impact of delayed costs whatever the species, suggesting that the dynamics of species that are not fish-adverse could also suffer from the introduction of fish.","Univ Lyon 1, Lab Ecol Hydrosyst Fluviaux, F-191869622 Villeurbanne, France","Plenet, S (corresponding author), Univ Lyon 1, Lab Ecol Hydrosyst Fluviaux, 41-43 Bd 11 Novembre, F-191869622 Villeurbanne, France.",plenet@univ-lyon1.fr,"Teplitsky, Celine/H-3621-2019","Teplitsky, Celine/0000-0001-9458-709X",NA,NA,NA,39,77,83,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,NA,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2003,134,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,270,277,NA,10.1007/s00442-002-1106-2,NA,NA,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,642UH,WOS:000180822900013,12647168,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

The same modification is also applied to a couple of other measures in use, providing them with convenient odds interpretations. These measures are all members of the same parameterized family, which represents a slight modification of the Hill's family. The inverse of OD is proposed as an odds measure of species homogeneity.

In other words, we know that plant traits can vary widely for a given genotype, but we know little about the importance of trait-mediated interactions (TMI) among plants. Here, we discuss three major factors that affect the expression of phenotypic plasticity: variation in the abiotic environment, variation in the presence or identity of neighbors, and variation in herbivory. We consider how plastic responses to these factors might affect interactions among plants. Plastic responses to the abiotic environment have important consequences for conditionality in competitive effects, to the point of causing shifts from competitive to facilitative interactions. Because plants show a high degree of plasticity in response to neighbors, and even to the specific identify of neighbors, phenotypic plasticity may allow species to adjust to the composition of their communities, promoting coexistence and community diversity. Likewise, plastic responses to consumers may have various and counterintuitive consequences: induction of plant resistance, compensatory growth, and increased resource uptake may affect interactions among plants in ways that cannot be predicted simply by considering biomass lost to consumers. What little we know about TMI among plants suggests that they should not be ignored in plant community theory. Although work to date on the community consequences of phenotypic plasticity has been hampered by experimental constraints, new approaches such as manipulating phenotypes by using signals instead of actual environmental conditions and the use of transgenic plants should allow us to rapidly expand our understanding of the community consequences of plant plasticity.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA; Univ Georgia, Dept Bot, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Callaway, RM (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",callaway@selway.umt.edu,"Pennings, Steven C/A-8326-2013; Richards, Christina/C-6455-2008","Pennings, Steven C/0000-0003-4757-7125; Richards, Christina/0000-0001-7848-5165",NA,NA,NA,181,347,378,17,316,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,NA,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2003,84,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,1115,1128,NA,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1115:PPAIAP]2.0.CO;2,NA,NA,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,700PN,WOS:000184120500004,NA,Green Published,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

The statistical analysis revealed a statistically significant quadratic dependence between the radon flow density from the earth's surface and the subsoil radon volumetric activity in the studied soils with the various grain-size distribution. This trend was determined in the summer during the data analysis of synchronous and space-aligned measurements of the radon field specified parameters in the soil. According to the grain-size distribution, the studied soils are specified by light (23%), medium-textured (25%), and heavy clay (27%) loams, less often by the sandy loams (14%) and sands (11%). The average radon flow density in the sands and sandy loams is 1.1 and 1.7 times lower, and in the light and medium-textured loams is 55% and 21% lower, respectively than in the heavy clay loams prevailing at a depth of 0.4-1 m. The most sensitive parameter of the radon field to the soil grain-size distribution for the combined spatiotemporal measurements is the ratio of the radon flow density from the earth's surface to the subsoil radon volumetric activity, that is, the radon transfer rate. It is confirmed by the works of other authors. A linear decrease in the radon flow rate from a depth of 1 m to the soil surface was revealed.","[Alimova, Gulsem Salimovna; Tokareva, Alena Yur'evna] Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, Tobolsk Complex Sci Stn, 15 Acad Yury Osipov St, Tobolsk 626152, Russia","Alimova, GS (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, Tobolsk Complex Sci Stn, 15 Acad Yury Osipov St, Tobolsk 626152, Russia.",gulsem76@mail.ru,"alimova, gulsem/AAU-5747-2021; Alena, Tokareva/AAU-5879-2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,19,0,0,0,0,"NATL CAVE RESEARCH & PROTECTION ORGANIZATION, INDIA",RAIPUR,"3-40 CIVIL LINES, RAJATALAB, RAIPUR, CG 492001, INDIA",2348-5191,2348-8980,NA,AMBIENT SCI,Ambient Sci.,NA,2021,8,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.21276/ambi.2021.08.1.ra03,NA,NA,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QY7GG,WOS:000630204700004,NA,gold,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

Long-term observations of leaves were made in trees standing either within intermittently flooded waterways or at an average of 37.5 m from the edge of the waterways. The mean soil moisture content was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) greater in the waterways than in the non-flooded areas. Trees in the higher soil moisture regime produced significantly larger basal area increments and increased canopy leaf area. This increase in canopy leaf area was achieved, in part, through a significant increase in leaf longevity and mean leaf size. Although a greater number of leaves was initiated and abscissed per shoot from the non-flooded trees, more leaves were collected from litter traps beneath the denser canopies of the flooded trees. Consumption of foliage by insects on the trees subjected to flooding compared to the non-flooded trees was not significantly different. However, the relative impact of insect herbivory was significantly greater on the non-flooded trees. Leaf chewing was the most common form of damage by insects, particularly Chrysomelidae and Curculionidae. No species was present in outbreak during this study. Leaf survival decreased as the per cent area eaten per leaf increased.

However, a type of data already available from mark-recapture studies (dates of capture and recapture of individually marked animals) can reveal social substructure within snake populations. If individuals associate with each other in social groups, we expect synchrony in the dates of capture and recapture of those animals. A field study of turtle-headed sea snakes (Emydocephalus annulatus) in New Caledonia reveals exactly this phenomenon. For example, animals that were captured on the same day in one year often were recaptured on the same day the following year. Analysis rejects non-social interpretations of these data (such as spatial-temporal confounding in sampling, intrapopulation heterogeneity in cues for activity), suggesting instead that many individual sea snakes belong to 'social' groups that consistently move about together. The phenomenon of capture synchrony during mark-recapture studies can provide new insights into the occurrence and correlates of cryptic social aggregations.","Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Shine, R (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",rics@bio.usyd.edu.au,"Shine, Richard/B-8711-2008","Shine, James/0000-0003-1762-5499",NA,NA,NA,49,18,19,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,NA,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,NOV,2005,30,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,805,811,NA,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01524.x,NA,NA,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,971OK,WOS:000232393600010,NA,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

Carotenoids are micronutrients with many beneficial health-related effects. They are effective antioxidants and stimulants of the immune system. Carotenoids cannot be synthesized in animals and must be obtained from food. As such, they may limit reproductive output and performance, and on the proximate level mediate reproductive trade-offs. 2. We studied carotenoid limitation in wild Great Tits (Parus major) by supplementing prelaying and laying females with lutein, the most abundant carotenoid in this species. We followed the effects of this supplementation on egg yolk carotenoid composition, and offspring and parental performance. 3. Females transferred the supplemented lutein into egg yolks, increasing lutein concentration to the upper limit of naturally occurring concentrations in control pairs. Concentrations of zeaxanthin, beta-carotene and alpha-carotene did not differ between supplemented and control pairs. 4. Effects on offspring and parental performance were generally absent or weak. There were no effects on timing of laying, clutch size, hatching success, nestling survival, nestling mass (day 6 and 14), tarsus length or T-cell mediated immune response. Males on supplemented nests fed their young more than those on control nests. There was no positive effect on female feeding or mass. 5. Negligible effects of lutein supplementation on offspring and parental performance might be explained by high natural abundance of carotenoids or other antioxidants, where additional carotenoids bear no strong advantage to the birds. Additionally, conflicting results of different studies may be explained by species-specific features of their life-histories.","Palacky Univ, Dept Zool, CZ-77146 Olomouc, Czech Republic; Nat Hist Museum, CZ-77173 Olomouc, Czech Republic; Univ Milan, Ist Chim Organ A Marchesini, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Remes, V (corresponding author), Palacky Univ, Dept Zool, Tr Svobody 26, CZ-77146 Olomouc, Czech Republic.",vladimir.remes@upol.cz,"Remes, Vladimir/B-6842-2016",NA,NA,NA,NA,38,20,20,0,11,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,NA,NA,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

We investigated habitat preferences to understand how different cockroach species coexist in sugar-cane fields on Reunion island. Cockroach populations belonging to a guild of seven species were surveyed during one annual cycle in eight sugar-cane fields that differed by several environmental factors, in order to investigate ecological features of cockroach species and their patterns of coexistence. Structure variations of the cockroach communities were analyzed at the field scale, at the sample unit scale, and according to variations of environmental conditions related to the annual sugar-cane growth cycle. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to elucidate relationships between species diversity, population abundance and environmental characteristics. The examination of partitioning at different spatial and temporal scales evidenced that each species occupied a particular type of habitat. The main factors influencing spatial habitat selection were at the sample unit scale: presence of ants, edge effect, soil moisture and granulometry, at the field scale: irrigation, annual rainfall, altitude and age of the field. Although a pair of species shared the same type of habitat, annual population peaks of each species did not coincide in time. This suggests that resource partitioning is based both on ecological factors and interspecific competition. Factors enhancing cockroach coexistence and factors favoring population outbursts are discussed as well as specific invasive capacities of these cockroaches and the role of the cockroach community in the sugar-cane trophic web.

Two species of host trees, C. sinensis and C. jessoensis (height = 2 m or more) were found in riparian forests on sandbanks (hereinafter, riparian forest), in forest regenerated after landslides on valley walls (landslide tracks), in secondary deciduous forests consisting mainly of Quercus acutissima or Quercus serrata and in forests established at abandoned paddy fields and their periphery, where weeds and shrubs used to be mown frequently to avoid shade on the paddies before their abandonment. This suggests that they are pioneer species, and their distribution and regeneration depend on natural and/or human disturbances. Host trees above 2 m were preferred by larvae, and there were very few such trees in secondary forests. More overwintering larvae occurred in riparian forests than at other sites. The number of S. charonda adults was highest at the edge of riparian forests, and we observed a variety of behaviors such as puddling, chasing and mating there. Although the number of adult butterflies was smaller inside and at the edge of secondary forests than in riparian forests, puddling by males and roosting on the trunk of Q. acutissima or Q. serrata by females were observed more frequently there than in riparian forests. Thus, we conclude that landscapes including both riparian forests with natural disturbance and secondary forests with Quercus trees are necessary to maintain host Celtis trees and S. charonda populations.","[Kobayashi, Takato; Kitahara, Masahiko] Yamanashi Inst Environm Sci, Lab Anim Ecol, Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi 4030005, Japan; [Nakashizuka, Tohru] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Kubo, Masako] Yamanashi Forest Res Inst, Masuho, Yamanashi 4000502, Japan; [Ito, Shoko] Utsunomiya Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Forest Ecol & Silviculture, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3218505, Japan","Kobayashi, T (corresponding author), K-101,2-2-18 Umezono, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050045, Japan.",takatokoba46@yahoo.co.jp,"Nakashizuka, Tohru/AAO-1081-2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,26,2,3,0,13,SPRINGER TOKYO,TOKYO,"1-11-11 KUDAN-KITA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 102-0073, JAPAN",0912-3814,NA,NA,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Maculinea butterflies have highly specialized larvae that sequentially exploit a plant and an ant species. Our study establishes that M. arion's specialized life cycle, including scramble competition for limiting resources, and the spatially discrete nature of its resources, make it more sensitive to environmental variation and more prone to local extinction than other univoltine phytophagous species. We find that the number and spatial distribution of the butterfly's resources are key factors in their population dynamics, especially for M. arion populations in habitats associated with high larval survival and high adult fecundity. Factors that increase juvenile competition have first a positive effect on adult population size, but beyond a threshold this effect becomes negative. In general, oscillatory dynamics emerge for high potential growth rates and spatially homogeneous juvenile competition. We discuss the relevance of our results to population management, investigate the consequences of environmental variation, and consider different scenarios of conservation. Our model, although based on the Maculinea genus, should apply to a broad range of species for which the form of competitive interactions changes predictably at distinct points in the life cycle. Complex life cycles can lead to negative feedbacks involving parameters that are usually thought to optimize population size. We suggest that conservation strategies are neither generalizable for the Maculinea genus nor for disparate populations of each species of Maculinea, and rather that management should be conducted on a case-by-case basis.","Univ Montpellier 2, ISEM, UMR 5554, F-34095 Montpellier, France; NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Dorset Lab, Winfrith Technol Ctr, Dorchester DT2 8ZD, England","Mouquet, N (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier 2, ISEM, UMR 5554, Pl Eugene Bataillon,CC065, F-34095 Montpellier, France.",nmouquet@univ-montp2.fr,"Clarke, Ralph T/B-3859-2009; MOUQUET, Nicolas/AAL-1440-2021; Thomas, Jeremy/A-9619-2013; Mouquet, Nicolas/G-1285-2010","Mouquet, Nicolas/0000-0003-1840-6984",NA,NA,NA,54,32,34,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,NA,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

To avoid misinterpretation, existing definitions of alpha and beta must be replaced by a definition that partitions diversity into independent alpha and beta components. Such a unique definition is derived here. When these new alpha and beta components are transformed into their numbers equivalents ( effective numbers of elements), Whittaker's multiplicative law ( alpha x beta gamma) is necessarily true for all indices. The new beta gives the effective number of distinct communities. The most popular similarity and overlap measures of ecology (Jaccard, Sorensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indices) are monotonic transformations of the new beta diversity.

If management (treatment) is applied nonrandomly, as in observational studies, then analysis must account for the potential confounding caused by variables that could have influenced both treatment assignment and the outcome of interest. Methods that do not adjust for all confounding variables can only estimate associations between treatment and outcome, not treatment effects. Data collected in observational studies are usually analysed with linear or generalized linear models, which can estimate treatment effects by adjusting for confounding variables. However, if there is little overlap in the distributions of confounding variables among the treatment groups then conventional regression extrapolates to areas of the covariate space where at least one of the treatment groups was unlikely to be observed. An alternative procedure for assessing treatment effects is to use the propensity score, which is the probability of treatment assignment given potential confounding variables. The propensity score can be used to reduce systematic differences in confounding variables among the treatment groups, ensuring that data more closely resemble that expected under a randomized experiment. The propensity score also identifies situations where treatment inferences must rely on strong assumptions. We used Monte Carlo simulation to examine the properties of commonly used propensity score methods for estimating treatment effects in the presence of nonrandom allocation of treatments. We then illustrated their application in a case study estimating the effects of invasive herbivore management on tree condition. Our results indicate that propensity score methods can be robust to model misspecification, allowing the estimation of average causal effects and resulting in more reliable inferences. We discuss key considerations for using propensity score methods for analysing ecological data.","[Ramsey, David S.

For this investigation, 230 fragments were transplanted directly to El Remanso reef, and another 150 fragments were maintained in in situ nurseries. Every 2 months, the length, weight, and survival of the fragments were recorded. After growing for 134 days in the nurseries, the 52 surviving fragments were transplanted to El Remanso reef, and after 5 months, the same variables were measured. Among the nursery-reared fragments, the largest (4 to <8 cm) had the highest survival and growth rates, whereas among the directly transplanted fragments, the smallest fragments (<2 cm) had the highest survival and growth rates. However, the nursery-reared fragments acquired greater structural complexity (arborescent morphology), and they were all alive 156 days after transplantation and presented a maximum linear growth rate of over 2 cm, which was higher than that of the directly transplanted fragments. Apparently, the arborescent morphology acquired during the nursery period provides advantages to the colonies that favor greater success when transplanted. Therefore, nursery-reared fragments of P. damicornis between 2 and 4 cm are the most appropriate for use in restoration projects.","[Ishida-Castaneda, Jun; Zapata, Fernando A.] Univ Valle, Dept Biol, Cali 760032, Colombia; [Pizarro, Valeria] Fdn ECOMARES, Cali 760050, Valle Del Cauca, Colombia; [Lopez-Victoria, Mateo] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Dept Nat Sci & Math, Cali 760008, Colombia; [Ishida-Castaneda, Jun] Univ Ryukyus, Trop Biosphere Res Ctr, 3422 Sesoko, Motobu, Okinawa 9050227, Japan","Ishida-Castaneda, J (corresponding author), Univ Valle, Dept Biol, Cali 760032, Colombia.; Ishida-Castaneda, J (corresponding author), Univ Ryukyus, Trop Biosphere Res Ctr, 3422 Sesoko, Motobu, Okinawa 9050227, Japan.",junpanese@gmail.com,NA,NA,National Natural Parks of Colombia,Special thanks to the National Natural Parks of Colombia for financial and logistical support and to the Universidad del Valle and the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali for providing equipment.

This quantitative examination of larval interactions between C. septempunctata and Coleomegilla maculata (DeCeer) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), a Nearctic coccinellid, was conducted under controlled prey densities. Larvae of both coccinellid species are affected by a limited diet [one pea aphid per day Acrythosiphon pisum (Harris) (Homoptera: Aphididae)] compared with an excess diet (> 20 aphids per day). Larval survival decreased from 86 to 63% in C. maculata and from 84 to 33% in C. septempunctata; mean preimaginal developmental time increased from 20.6 to 26.7 days in C. maculata, and from 18.1 to 32.0 days in C. septempunctata. Additionally, on one aphid per day, mean adult weight was reduced from 12.39 to 9.79 mg in C. maculata, and from 39.57 to 14.44 mg in C. septempunctata. Interspecific interactions, favoring C. septeumpunctata over C. maculata at a low prey density (one aphid per day), take the form of reduced survival of C. maculata compared with C. septempunctata (14 versus 66%). Reduced survival of C. maculata may be the result of competition for aphids or intraguild predation by C. septempunctata on C. maculata. No interspecific interactions (measured as effects on larval survival, preimaginal developmental time, and adult weight) were observed between larvae of these two species at a high prey density (> 20 aphids per predator per day).","Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Entomol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Oklahoma State Univ, Stillwater, OK USA","Obrycki, JJ (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Entomol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,48,104,112,0,13,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,NA,NA,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NA,1998,117,1-2,NA,NA,NA,NA,279,285,NA,10.1007/s004420050659,NA,NA,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,144YZ,WOS:000077344700036,28308499,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

In the first stage, an individual-based forest ecosystem carbon flux model (IntCarb) at stand scale is developed. IntCarb combines components from,the ZELIG and CENTURY models to simulate forest development and heterotrophic respiration, respectively. Stand scale carbon fluxes simulated by IntCarb strongly depend on stand age. A forest stand can be a carbon sink for up to 200 years old with a peak at 30-40 years old. Old-growth stands are carbon neutral to the atmosphere in the long term. For any particular year, an old-growth stand can be either a carbon sink or source. The interannual variation of Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) for an old-growth stand is primarily determined by heterotrophic respiration. Due to the high spatial variability of stand ages, forest age structure needs to be taken into account to improve estimation of carbon budgets of forest ecosystems over large areas. In the stand stage, a regional carbon budget model (RegCarb) is developed to estimate regional carbon fluxes over large areas based on forest age structure, adjusting for the nonrespiratory carbon losses (timber harvesting). Our initial estimate with RegCarb for the Pacific Northwest of the United States indicates that this region was a tremendous carbon source to the atmosphere from 1890 to 1990 due to extensive logging of old-growth forest. Projection for the role of forests in this region in global carbon cycle in the future strongly depend on the amount of timber to be harvested, i.e. how the age structure of forests in this region is to be altered.

This area suffered by Great East Japan Earthquake 2011 and continental shelf and slope off of this area considered one of the most productive areas both for fishery and primary production in the world because of the complex mixture of the Kuroshio Current, Oyashio Current, and Tsugaru Warm Current. We compiled 3415 images of animals, stones, and sediments. Most of the images are of dominant species of Ophiuroidea (brittle stars), with 789 and 1421 images captured in two areas of different depth. These images are cropped from downward camera images collected during two dives in 2015 using remotely operated vehicles in a deeper area (670-800 m deep) off Kamaishi (cruise id KY15-08; dive no. HPD1812) and a shallower area (280 m deep) off Minami Sanriku town (cruise id NT15-E04; dive no. CRB17). The attribute of each image is listed in the subsequent comma delimited (csv) text file and the observed occurrence of each organisms was also converted into the text format used in Japan Ocean Biogeographic Information System Center (J-OBIS), which is comparable with Darwin Core 2.0. Basically, we recorded the higher taxonomic levels (e.g., order and class) that could be specified with certainty and added a list of potential species as an appendix. For better understanding the broad-scale impact of the earthquake along the continental shelf and slope, it is necessary to extract occurrence data of organisms from biological surveys. Gathering image or video data is appropriate for this purpose because most underwater surveys simultaneously record images and/or videos. This dataset will add the information of the status after 4 years of the disaster. These image data are also considered as training image data set for automatic extraction of organisms.","[Yamakita, Takehisa; Fujiwara, Yoshihiro; Kawato, Masaru; Tsuchida, Shinji; Ishibashi, Shojiro; Fujikura, Katsunori] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, Project Team Analyses Changes East Japan Marine E, 2-15 Natsushima Cho, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; [Yokooka, Hiroyuki] IDEA Consultants Inc, Inst Environm Ecol, 1334-5 Riemon, Yaizu, Shizuoka 4210212, Japan; [Kurokawa, Tadayuki] IDEA Consultants Inc, Inst Environm Informat, Tsuzuki Ku, 2-2-2 Hayabuchi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2240025, Japan; [Yamakita, Takehisa] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biosphere Sci, Environm Dynam & Management Grp, 1-3-2 Kagamiyama, Hiroshima 7398511, Japan","Yamakita, T (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, Project Team Analyses Changes East Japan Marine E, 2-15 Natsushima Cho, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan.",yamakitat@jamstec.go.jp,NA,"Yokooka, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-4486-3524",NA,NA,NA,0,4,4,0,8,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",0912-3814,1440-1703,NA,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Changes in mean aridity associated with climate change can generate ecotype by environment mismatch (i.e., climatic displacement). At the same time, variability around these shifting means is predicted to increase, resulting in more extreme droughts. We characterized the effects of two axes of climate change, climatic displacement and drought, on the shrub Artemisia californica and its arthropods. We established common gardens of plants sourced along an aridity gradient (3.5-fold variation in mean annual precipitation) in an arid region of the species distribution, thus generating a gradient of climatic displacement (sustained increase in aridity) as predicted with climate change. We surveyed plants and arthropods over eight years where precipitation varied sixfold, including both extreme drought and relatively mesic conditions. These two axes of climate change interacted to influence plant performance, such that climatically displaced populations grew slowly regardless of drought and suffered substantial mortality during drought years. Conversely, local populations grew quickly, increased growth during wet years, and had low mortality regardless of drought. Effects on plant annual arthropod yield were negative and additive, with drought effects exceeding that of climatic displacement by 24%. However, for plant lifetime arthropod yield, incorporating effects on both plant growth and survival, climatic displacement exacerbated the negative effects of drought. Collectively these results demonstrate how climatic displacement (through increasing aridity stress) strengthens the negative effects of drought on plants and, indirectly, on arthropods, suggesting the possibility of climate-mediated trophic collapse.","[Croy, Jordan R.; Pratt, Jessica D.; Mooney, Kailen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Sheng, Daniel] Cty Angeles Fire Dept, Div Forestry, Los Angeles, CA 91773 USA","Croy, JR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",jcroy@uci.edu,NA,"Croy, Jordan/0000-0002-4743-0302","Newkirk Center for Science and Society; Orange County Association of Environmental Professionals; Newport Bay Conservancy; Lake Forest Garden Club; UC-Irvine Graduate Division; NSF-DEBNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1120794, 1354734]; NSF-DGENational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF- Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR) [1321846]; Victor and Virginia Voth Foundation;  [NSF-GK12 DGE-0638751];  [EPA-STAR FP-91724101]","We thank our field and lab assistants for help with data collection and arthropod sample processing.

Browsing has been suggested to decrease the carbohydrate reserves in woody plants, which might lead to reduced tannin production in leaves during the following summer, and consequently, to increased herbivore damage on leaves. We conducted a clipping experiment with mature mountain birch trees and measured the effects of clipping on birch growth, leaf chemistry and toughness, as well as on the performance of insect herbivores. Leaves grew larger and heavier per unit area in the clipped ramets and had a higher content of proteins than leaves in the control trees. Clipping treatment did not affect the total content of sugars in the leaves (mg g(-1)), suggesting that a moderate level of clipping did not significantly reduce the carbohydrate pools of fully-grown mountain birch trees. Furthermore, the contents of proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) and gallotannins were slightly higher in the leaves of clipped ramets, contrary to the hypothesis of reduced tannin production. The effects of clipping treatment on leaf and shoot growth and on foliar chemistry were mainly restricted to the clipped ramets, without spreading to untreated ramets within the same tree individual. The effects of clipping on leaf characters varied during the growing season; for instance, leaf toughness in clipped ramets was higher than toughness in control trees and ramets only when leaves were mature. Accordingly, clipping had inconsistent effects on insect herbivores feeding at different times of the growing season. The generally small impact of clipping on herbivore performance suggests that the low intensity of natural browsing at the study area, simulated by our clipping treatment, does not have strong consequences for the population dynamics of insect herbivores on mountain birch via enhanced population growth caused by browsing-induced changes in food quality.","Turku Univ, Subarct Res Stn, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Turku Univ, Dept Chem, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland","Riipi, M (corresponding author), Turku Univ, Subarct Res Stn, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",mariipi@utu.fi,"Ossipov, Vladimir/M-2717-2016","Ossipov, Vladimir/0000-0002-8383-9965",NA,NA,NA,50,20,20,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,NA,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2005,111,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,221,234,NA,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13781.x,NA,NA,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,979XU,WOS:000232979300003,NA,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

I Studied a portion of a pollination web involving a generalist pollinator, the oil-collecting bee Rediviva peringueyi, and a community of oil-secreting plants. Across 27 established conservation areas located in the Cape Floral Region, I found substantial variation in the bees' occurrence in relation to soil type and the successional stage of the vegetation. Anthropogenic declines were detectable against this background of naturally occurring variation: R. peringueyi was absent from small conservation areas (<385 ha) in an urban matrix. In the absence of the bee, seed set failed in six specialist plant species that are pollinated only by R. peringueyi but remained high in a pollination generalist, which had replacement pollinators. The findings are consistent with theoretical predictions of the importance of generalist pollinators in maintaining the structure of pollination webs.","Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","Pauw, A (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag 11, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",apauw@sun.ac.za,"Pauw, Anton/A-6126-2008","Pauw, Anton/0000-0002-4012-648X",NA,NA,NA,51,134,142,5,129,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,NA,NA,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2007,88,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,1759,1769,NA,10.1890/06-1383.1,NA,NA,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,185SN,WOS:000247730800016,17645022,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

We investigated how a natural population of ovipositing treefrogs, Hyla chrysoscelis, partitioned their eggs amongst experimental ponds differing in the non-lethal presence of five fish predators, each representing a distinct family. Four fish predators were functionally equivalent in terms of the behavioral response they induced in H. chrysoscelis females and hence the distribution of larval H. chrysoscelis. Mean number of H. chrysoscelis eggs deposited was significantly decreased by the mere presence of these predators relative to controls, with three species eliciting a complete avoidance (e.g. no eggs deposited). One fish predator, Aphredoderus sayanus, was statistically indistinguishable from the control treatment. These data mimic patterns of species distribution observed in nature in response to the presence of fish, but suggest an alternative mechanism for generating patterns of prey abundance amongst habitats differing in their predator composition.

CO2FIX V.2 is a multi-cohort ecosystem-level model based on carbon accounting of forest stands, including forest biomass, soils and products. Carbon stored in living biomass is estimated with a forest cohort model that allows for competition, natural mortality, logging, and mortality due to logging damage. Soil carbon is modeled using five stock pools, three for litter and two for humus. The dynamics of carbon stored in wood products is simulated with a set of pools for short-, medium- and long-lived products, and includes processing efficiency, re-use of by-products, recycling, and disposal forms. The CO2FIX V.2 model estimates total carbon balance of alternative management regimes in both even and uneven-aged forests, and thus has a wide applicability for both temperate and tropical conditions. Results for the model testing and validation in selected temperate and tropical forest management systems are presented and discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The aim was conducted in order to determine the potential ability of this plant for cleaning up contaminated soil. Food grown on such lands usually contains heavy metals. Phytoremediation treatment of the soil prevents their entry into food, because it reduces the concentration of pollutants. Eighty-five Red clover one month old plants were grown in a nursery until transplant into the contaminated soil by inorganic As. Leaves and roots of 60 of plants sample were taken separately in every ten day during 60 days and analysed by ICP-OES while 25 samples were kept in different pH (8-4) in contaminated soil samples. Mean values of inorganic As(V) and As(III) in shoots and roots of plants were determined, and the statistical approaches were used for establishing the differences Bioaccumulation factor was calculated for As contents of plant parts for every 10 days. The soil arsenic level (19.09 mg/kg) higher than the global average (10.0 mg/kg), but within the maximum acceptable limit for agricultural soil (20.0 mg/kg) recommended by the European Union after 10 days. The lowest mean arsenic concentration was found after 40 days of cultivation of plant in pH=6 (1.01 mg/kg). It was observed that Red clover had suitable ability for phytoextraction method and soil recovery more Arsenic in pH<7 after 20-30 days of growth. The rate of As uptake by Red clover was significantly affected by the grown days after cultivated in contaminated treated (p<0.05) and pH of soil while up-taking in pH=6 (p-value <0.05).","[Ziarati, Parisa] Islamic Azad Univ, Tehran Med Sci, Nutr & Food Sci Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Vambol, Viola] Publ Agcy Natl Sci & Res Inst Ind Safety & Occupa, Kiev, Ukraine; [Vambol, Sergij] Kharkiv Petro Vasylenko Natl Tech Univ Agr, Kharkiv, Ukraine","Ziarati, P (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Tehran Med Sci, Nutr & Food Sci Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran.",ziarati.p@iaups.ac.ir,NA,NA,"Nutrition and Food Sciences Research Center, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University","Supports from Nutrition and Food Sciences Research Center, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University is gratefully acknowledged.",NA,20,1,1,0,0,WYDAWNICTWO UNIWERSYTETU MIKOLAJA KOPERNIKA,TORUN,"UL.

A maternal effect common in egg-laying vertebrates is provisioning of the yolk with carotenoids, organic pigments that often color sexual ornaments and are hypothesized to play positive and substantial physiological roles. In a recent study, yolks of great tit (Parus major) eggs were directly supplemented with carotenoids, and the effects on offspring fitness proxies measured (Marri and Richner in Oecologia 176:371-377, 2014a). Nestlings from supplemented broods were heavier early in development and more likely to fledge, but otherwise equivalent to control nestlings. The authors consider in detail the potential physiological mechanisms that might underlie this result, and here I expand on their Discussion by considering a non-exclusive explanation: that parents provided higher quality care to broods that received supplemental carotenoids. I discuss the general non-independence of pre- and post-hatching/parturition maternal effects when parents care for offspring, and then briefly review evidence that carotenoids specifically are tied to the intensity of avian begging displays. Finally, I detail how inclusive fitness opportunities and constraints shape the adaptive landscape in which maternal effects operate, highlighting both theoretical and applied concerns surrounding questions about the adaptiveness of maternal effects.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Dugas, MB (corresponding author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, DeGrace Hall,2080 Adelbert Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",matthew.b.dugas@gmail.com,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,41,3,3,1,44,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,NA,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,2015,177,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,1089,1092,NA,10.1007/s00442-015-3266-x,NA,NA,4,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CE0CD,WOS:000351470100015,25694043,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

Furthermore, new JSDM implementations have been illustrated with different case studies, preventing direct comparisons of computational and statistical performance. We aim to resolve these outstanding issues by (a) highlighting similarities among seven presence-absence JSDMs using a clearly defined, singular notation; and (b) evaluating the computational and statistical performance of each JSDM using six datasets that vary widely in numbers of sites, species, and environmental covariates considered. Our singular notation shows that many of the JSDMs are very similar, and in turn parameter estimates of different JSDMs are moderate to strongly, positively correlated. In contrast, the different JSDMs clearly differ in computational efficiency and memory limitations. Our framework will allow ecologists to make educated decisions about the JSDM that best suits their objective, and enable wider uptake of JSDM methods among the ecological community.","[Wilkinson, David P.; Golding, Nick; Guillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta; Tingley, Reid; McCarthy, Michael A.] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic, Australia","Wilkinson, DP (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",davidpw@student.unimelb.edu.au,"Golding, Nick/ABD-1572-2020; Wilkinson, David/AAH-2705-2020; Guillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta/F-7461-2015; McCarthy, Michael/O-5655-2014","Wilkinson, David/0000-0002-9560-6499; Guillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta/0000-0002-8387-5739; Golding, Nick/0000-0001-8916-5570; McCarthy, Michael/0000-0003-1039-7980; Tingley, Reid/0000-0002-7630-7434","Australian Government Research Training ProgramAustralian Government; University of MelbourneUniversity of Melbourne; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DE160100904, DE170100601]","Australian Government Research Training Program; University of Melbourne; Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DE160100904 and DE170100601",NA,53,24,24,6,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,NA,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

Here we present diurnal and vertical patterns of water isotope ratios in forest air (delta H-2(v) and delta O-18(v)) not observed previously. Water vapor observed at three heights over 3 consecutive days in a coniferous forest in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, shows a stratified nocturnal structure of delta H-2(v) and delta O-18(v), with the most positive values consistently observed above the canopy (60 m). Differences between 0.5 m and 60 m range between 2-6aEuro degrees for delta O-18 and 20-40aEuro degrees for delta H-2 at night. Using a box model, we simulated H2O isotope fluxes and showed that the low to high delta H-2(v) and delta O-18(v) profiles can be explained by the vapor flux associated with evaporation from the forest floor and canopy transpiration. We used d-excess as a diagnostic tracer to identify processes that contribute to the diurnal variation in atmospheric moisture. Values of d-excess derived from water vapor measurements showed a repeated diel pattern, with the lowest values occurring in the early morning and the highest values occurring at midday. The isotopic composition of rain water, collected during a light rain event in the first morning of our experiment, suggested that considerable below-cloud secondary evaporation occurred during the descent of raindrops. We conclude that atmospheric entrainment appears to drive the isotopic variation of water vapor in the early morning when the convective boundary layer rapidly develops, while evapotranspiration becomes more important in the mid-afternoon as a primary moisture source of water vapor in this forest. Our results demonstrate the interplay between the effects of vegetation and boundary layer mixing under the influence of rain evaporation, which has implications for larger-scale predictions of precipitation across the terrestrial landscape.","[Lai, Chun-Ta] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Ehleringer, James R.] Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Lai, CT (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",lai@sciences.sdsu.edu,"Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010",NA,"office of Science (BER), US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-06ER64309]; National Institute for Climatic Change Research (NICCR); US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FC02-06ER64156]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [AGS-0956425]; Directorate For GeosciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [0956425] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank the two anonymous reviewers for their comments that improved the quality of this work.

Yet, how stressors shape the consistency ('repeatability') of traits and their covariation at the individual level remains debated. We studied how seasonal time constraints shape trait repeatability and integration of life-history, behavioural and physiological traits along a fast-slow continuum, using the 'pace-of-life syndrome' as a framework. We manipulated the photoperiod during the larval development of the damselfly Ischnura elegans, generating a time-relaxed early, a control, and a time-constrained late group. The photoperiod treatment did not seem to affect the voltinism of the larvae. As predicted, late-period larvae accelerated development and growth, yet this acceleration was no longer detectable for growth and metabolic rate during the final instar, possibly due to costs of the initial life-history acceleration. This warrants caution when inferring a species' pace-of-life based on a specific developmental stage. The late-period larvae were as predicted more active (only during the later stages of the final instar) and bolder than the control larvae, but not different from the early-period larvae. Most studies on time constraints only compared late and control animals, thereby potentially wrongly concluding adaptive responses to time constraints. Activity, boldness and body mass were repeatable, while growth and metabolic rates were not. Notably, repeatabilities did not change under time constraints. There was no support for an overall trait integration in a pace-of-life syndrome, yet activity and boldness covaried positively as expected. Importantly, this 'behavioural syndrome' was decoupled in the late-period larvae, which might be adaptive to enhance energy acquisition to fuel the accelerated development rate. Our results suggest that besides the predicted plastic acceleration of life-history, plastic changes in behavioural trait integration may also be an important but overlooked adaptive aspect of responding to time constraints.","[Tuzun, Nedim; Stoks, Robby] Univ Leuven, Evolutionary Stress Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Leuven, Belgium; [Savasci, Beste Basak] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Padua, Italy","Tuzun, N (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, Evolutionary Stress Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Leuven, Belgium.",nedim.tuzun@kuleuven.be,"Tuzun, Nedim/H-8114-2019","Tuzun, Nedim/0000-0002-4743-1743; Savasci, Beste Basak/0000-0002-9353-8883; Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459",FWO-FlandersFWO [G.0956.19]; KU Leuven grant [C16/17/002],"This work was supported by the research grant G.0956.19 from FWO-Flanders, and KU Leuven grant C16/17/002.",NA,94,1,1,2,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,NA,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2021,130,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,274,286,NA,10.1111/oik.07800,NA,DEC 2020,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QA8IC,WOS:000594912300001,NA,Green Published,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

Juvenile pike (Esox lucius), a cannibalistic fish species, aggregates within habitat patches. The advantages to cannibals of aggregating in the absence of other predators and food constraints are not immediately obvious. In this study we explore the basis for this grouping by observing how spatial distributions of juvenile pike are mediated by the presence of conspecifics. 2. Solitary pike preferred shallow-water (0.17 m depth) habitats. When fish density was increased, the average time spent in alternative deep-water habitat (0.33 m) increased, consistent with a despotic type of distribution and suggesting that interference was occurring. 3. In pairs of fish, one pike, nominally the dominant individual, showed a habitat use similar to that of single fish. The second individual mostly occupied deep water, again consistent with a despotic distribution and apparently mediated by intimidation interference. However, dominant pike did on occasion enter deep water, at which times the subordinate pike remained with the dominant fish, appearing to aggregate in the pool. 4. We propose that habitat-specific risk could explain aggregations of pike in deep water. Although remaining in close proximity to dominant individuals in deep water would seemingly put subordinate fish at great risk, the alternative of moving to shallow water may increase risk still further by reducing the capacity to perceive and/or evade attacks.","Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Gatty Marine Lab, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; Fisheries Res Serv Freshwater Lab, Faskally PH16 5LB, Pitlochry, Scotland","Hawkins, LA (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Gatty Marine Lab, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland.",lh36@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Magurran, Anne E/D-7463-2013","Magurran, Anne/0000-0002-0036-2795; Armstrong, John/0000-0003-2015-0500",NA,NA,NA,49,15,16,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,NA,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Although a number of studies have addressed responses of plant phenology to warming and altered precipitation individually, their interactions can alter plant phenology differently than either does independently. To explore how the interactions between global change drivers alter alpine ecosystems, we conducted a factorial experiment manipulating warming (ambient and +2 degrees C) and altered precipitation (50% decrease, control, and 50% increase) simultaneously in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. Over two years, we monitored plant phenological events, leafout day and first flowering day, for 11 common plant species that account for 74.4% of the total above biomass. Surprisingly, there was no interaction between warming and changes in precipitation on community plant phenology, but warming advanced leaf-out and first flowering day by 7.10 and 9.79 d, respectively. Unlike the community response, plant functional groups had a variety of direct and interactive responses to the experimental climate drivers. While the phenology of legumes was most influenced by temperature, temperature and precipitation interacted to alter the phenology of grasses and forbs. To explore how plant phenological sensitivity on the Tibetan Plateau is compared with other meadow ecosystems, we combined our dataset with a global plant phenology dataset. Interestingly, the phenological sensitivity of leaf-out day and first flowering day on the Tibetan Plateau is 7.3 and 37.8 times greater than global phenological sensitivity, respectively. This result highlights that a meta-analysis of global phenological sensitivity may significantly underestimate change in some regions-even regions as large as the Tibetan Plateau. Together, our results suggest that the Tibetan Plateau may experience rapid change as temperatures warm and that these changes will likely be more rapid than in other regions of the world. Further, our study highlights that if we are to make accurate predictions of how plant phenology may change with warming, we need to understand the specific environmental cues that drive phenological responses across different areas.","[Ji Suonan; He, Jin-Sheng] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc,Minist Educ, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ji Suonan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, 16 Lincui Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Ji Suonan; Classen, Aimee T.; Sanders, Nathan J.] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Classen, Aimee T.; Sanders, Nathan J.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Classen, Aimee T.; Sanders, Nathan J.] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [He, Jin-Sheng] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China","He, JS (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc,Minist Educ, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.; He, JS (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",jshe@pku.edu.cn,"Classen, Aimee/AAM-5671-2021; Classen, Aimee/X-2984-2019; Classen, Aimee T/C-4035-2008; Sanders, Nathan/ABE-4335-2020; Sanders, Nathan/A-6945-2009","Classen, Aimee T/0000-0002-6741-3470; Sanders, Nathan/0000-0001-6220-6731","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31570394, 31630009, 31800407]; National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954004, 2014CB954003]; Chinese Government Scholarship for Postgraduates, China Scholarship Council; Danish National Research FoundationDanmarks Grundforskningsfond; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Terrestrial Ecosystem Sciences programUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0010562]; 111 ProjectMinistry of Education, China - 111 Project [B14001]","Grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (#31570394, 31630009, 31800407) and the National Basic Research Program of China (#2014CB954004, 2014CB954003) supported this work.

The interest in AMF-nematode interactions ties in the possibility of enhanced resistance or tolerance of AMF-infected plants to nematodes, and the potential value of this for control of crop pests. Data collated from previous studies revealed a great diversity of AMF-nematode responses and we seek to generalise from these by evaluating and discussing interactions involving three groups of nematodes distinguished by their mode of parasitism: (i) ectoparasites; (ii) sedentary endoparasites; and (iii) migratory endoparasites. Based on proximity in tissue, we expected that the interactions between endoparasites and AMF would be stronger, i.e. more reciprocal effects of endoparasitic nematodes on AMF, than those between ectoparasites and AMF Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that, relative to AMF-free plants, AMF-infected plants were damaged more by ectoparasites than by endoparasites. Of the sedentary endoparasites, numbers of root-knot nematodes were reduced more by mycorrhizal. infection than were those of cyst nematodes. The reduction in nematode damage by AMF was not different for root-knot or cyst nematode infested plants. Migratory endoparasitic nematodes were the only group whose numbers were greater on AMF-infected plants. However, the experiments involving migratory nematodes were characterised by relatively high levels of AMF infection and little nematode damage compared to the other feeding types. The outcomes of the AMF-nematode interactions are determined by many factors during the interactions between organisms and their physical, physiological and temporal environments. Assessing effects by recording plant sizes and total nematode or AMF populations at the end of experiments gives very little information on the mechanisms of the interactions. It is time to stop doing studies of black boxes and time to start observing processes, directly by using microscopy and indirectly by application of molecular genetics.

In this article we propose a model of valuation with respect to conservation and restoration of nature. According to the model, valuation of nature can be characterized by a valuation approach, consisting of ecological, ethical and aesthetic perspectives. Such an approach includes scientific and normative aspects and leads to a particular claim of conservation. In this paper we discuss different perspectives, and accordingly, we sketch three main types of these valuation approaches.

Here, we overcame the problem of absent historical data by using resurrected seeds to capture historic plant-trait data for a number of plant regeneration and growth traits. We collected seed and seedling trait measurements from resurrected historic seeds and compared these with modern seed and seedling traits collected from the same species in the same geographic location. We found a total of 43 species from southeastern Australia for which modern/historic seed pairs could be located. These species were located in a range of regions that have undergone different amounts of climate change across a range of temperature, precipitation, and extreme measures of climate. There was a correlation between the amount of change in climate metrics, and the amount of change in plant traits. Using stepwise model selection, we found that for all regeneration and growth trait changes (except change in stem density), the most accurate model selected at least two measures of climate change. Changes in extreme measures of climate, such as heat-wave duration and changes in climate variability, were more strongly related to changes in regeneration and growth traits than changes in mean climate metrics. Across our species, for every 5% increase in temperature variability, there was a threefold increase in the probability of seed viability and seed germination success. An increase of 1 d in the maximum duration of dry spells through time led to a 1.5-fold decrease in seed viability and seeds became 30% flatter/thinner. Regions where the maximum heat-wave duration had increased by 10 d saw a 1.35-cm decrease in seedling height and a 1.04-g decrease in seedling biomass. Rapid responses in plant traits to changes in climate may be possible; however, it is not clear whether these changes will be fast enough for plants to keep pace with future climate change.","[Everingham, Susan E.; Moles, Angela T.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Everingham, Susan E.; Offord, Catherine A.] Australian Bot Garden, Australian PlantBank, Royal Bot Gardens & Domain Trust, Mt Annan, NSW 2567, Australia; [Sabot, Manon E.

Trait-based models of ecological communities typically assume intraspecific variation in functional traits is not important, although such variation can change species trait rankings along gradients in resources and environmental conditions, and thus influence community structure and function. 2. We examined the degree of intraspecific relative to interspecific variation, and reaction norms of 11 functional traits for 57 forest understorey plant species, including: intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE), Delta N-15, five leaf traits, two stem traits and two root traits along gradients in light, nitrogen, moisture and understorey cover. 3. Our results indicate that interspecific trait variation exceeded intraspecific variation by at least 50% for most, but not all traits. Intraspecific variation in Delta N-15, iWUE, leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and root traits was high (47-70%) compared with most leaf traits and stem traits (13-38%). 4. Delta N-15 varied primarily along gradients in abiotic conditions, while light and understorey cover were relatively less important. Intrinsic water-use efficiency was related primarily to light transmission, reflecting increases in photosynthesis relative to stomatal conductance. Leaf traits varied mainly as a function of light availability, with some reaction norms depending on understorey cover. Plant height increased with understorey cover, while stem-specific density was related primarily to light. Resources, environmental conditions and understorey cover did not contribute strongly to the observed variation in root traits. 5. Gradients in resources, environmental conditions and competition all appear to control intraspecific variability in most traits to some extent. However, our results suggest that species cross-over (i.e. trait rank reversals) along the gradients measured here are generally not a concern. 6. Intraspecific variability in understorey plant species traits can be considerable. However, trait data collected under a narrow range of environmental conditions appears sufficient to establish species rankings and scale between community and ecosystem levels using trait-based models. Investigators may therefore focus on obtaining a sufficient sample size within a single set of conditions rather than characterizing trait variation across entire gradients to optimize sampling efforts.","[Burton, Julia I.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Perakis, Steven S.] US Geol Survey, Forest & Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Corvallis, OR USA; [McKenzie, Sean C.] Montana State Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Lawrence, Caitlin E.] Oregon State Univ, Inst Nat Resources, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Puettmann, Klaus J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Burton, JI (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",julia.burton@usu.edu,"Burton, Julia/C-8395-2009","Burton, Julia/0000-0002-3205-8819","U.S. Bureau of Land Management [L15AC00009, L16AC00284]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, McIntire Stennis project [229410, UTA01305]","This research was supported with funding from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (Financial Assistance Agreement No. L15AC00009 to K.J.P. and J.I.B. and L16AC00284 to J.I.B.).

To examine the importance of this mechanism, I tested the following three hypotheses in a field experiment in 1990: (H-1) Folivory by the leaf beetle Trirhabda canadensis (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) increases availability of light, water, and N in monocultures of goldenrod (Solidago missouriensis). This hypothesis was partially supported. Folivory by Trirhabda reduced leaf, root, and total biomass of goldenrod and increased light penetration, soil water content, and soil nitrate concentration. However, Trirhabda grazing did not affect overall soil N availability. (H-2) The invasion of goldenrod monocultures by other plant species and the response of goldenrod to folivory reflects an increased availability of resources in monocultures grazed by Trirhabda. This hypothesis was supported. Folivory by Trirhabda raised the probability that a species would invade the experimental monocultures and increased the species richness of the invading plant assemblage. Relative growth rate of goldenrod and production of aboveground biomass by invaders were higher in monocultures grazed by Trirhabda than in ungrazed ones. Prostrate and creeping forbs increased in relative abundance following folivory by Trirhabda. (H-3) Reduced N uptake by goldenrod or increased N mineralization accompanies increased N availability in grazed monocultures. This hypothesis was also supported. Net N mineralization and nitrification were higher in monocultures grazed by Trirhabda than in ungrazed monocultures. Folivory by Trirhabda larvae reduced N uptake by goldenrod, but that of adults did not. The impact of herbivores upon plant communities may be effected through increased availability of important plant resources.","UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT ECOL & BEHAV BIOL, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,119,47,48,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,NA,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1994,75,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,1673,1683,NA,10.2307/1939627,NA,NA,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PE267,WOS:A1994PE26700015,NA,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

The decomposition rates of 3 species typical to undisturbed fens and 3 species that spontaneously colonize harvested fens were assessed. These species were incubated in both a restoration site (harvested fen) and an undisturbed fen to compare decomposition according to different environmental conditions. The average exponential decay coefficient (k) for all material types was slightly higher (circa 0.04.y(-1) higher) in the harvested fen than those observed in the undisturbed fen. However, the litter type (leaves, roots/rhizomes, or bryophyte fragments) had the largest impact on the decomposition rates. The 2 tested bryophytes had lower k-values (between 0.14 and 0.11 for Polytrichum strictum and 0.06 for Sphagnum centrale) than the vascular plant litter (between 0.25 and 0.50). The annual primary production of the tested species was also measured to estimate the peat-accumulating capacity of each species. Scirpus cyperinus had an annual primary production that was 3 times higher (1500 g.m(-2).y(-1)) than the other species (between 300 and 550 g.m(-2).y(-1)). Estimates show that the harvested fen has a high peat-accumulating potential due to the high biomass production observed at this site.","[Rochefort, Line] Univ Laval, Peatland Ecol Res Grp, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Nord, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada","Rochefort, L (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Peatland Ecol Res Grp, Pavillon Paul Comtois,2425 Rue Agr, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",line.rochefort@fsaa.ulaval.ca,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,60,25,25,0,30,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1195-6860,2376-7626,NA,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,NA,2009,16,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,158,166,NA,10.2980/16-2-3128,NA,NA,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,463XS,WOS:000267468000002,NA,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

In Australia's rangelands, the integrity of these patterns and processes have been modified by clearing, grazing and fire. Intuitively, biodiversity should be strongly related to functional integrity; that is, landscapes with high functional integrity should maintain biodiversity, and altered, less functional landscapes may lose some biodiversity, defined here as the variety and abundance of the plants, animals and microorganisms of concern. Simple indicators of biodiversity and functional integrity are needed that can be monitored at a range of scales, from fine to coarse. In the present paper, we use examples, primarily from published work on Australia's rangeland, to document that at finer patch and hillslope scales several indicators of landscape functional integrity have been identified. These indicators, based on the quantity and quality of vegetation patches and interpatch zones, are related to biodiversity. For example, a decrease in the cover and width (quantity) and condition (quality) of vegetation patches, and an increase in bare soil (quantity of interpatch) near cattle watering points in a paddock are significantly related to declines in plant and grasshopper diversity. These vegetation patch-cover and bare-soil indicators have been monitored traditionally by field-based methods, but new high-resolution, remote-sensing imagery can be used in specific rangeland areas for this fine-scale monitoring. At intermediate paddock and small watershed scales, indicators that can be derived from medium-resolution remote-sensing are also needed for efficient monitoring of rangeland condition (i.e. functional integrity) and biodiversity. For example, 30-100-m-pixel Landsat imagery has been used to assess the condition of rangelands along grazing gradients extending from watering-points. The variety and abundance of key taxa have been related to these gradients (the Biograze project). At still larger region and catchment scales, indicators of rangeland functional integrity can also be monitored by coarse-resolution remote-sensing and related to biodiversity. For example, the extent and greenness (condition) of different regional landscapes have been monitored with 1-km-pixel satellite imagery. This regional information becomes more valuable when it indicates differences as a result of land management. Finally, we discuss potential future developments that could improve proposed indicators of landscape functional integrity and biodiversity, thereby improving our ability to monitor rangelands effectively.","Trop Savannas CRC, Atherton, Qld 4883, Australia; CSIRO, Atherton, Qld 4883, Australia; CSIRO, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; CSIRO, Alice Springs, NT, Australia","Ludwig, JA (corresponding author), Trop Savannas CRC, POB 780, Atherton, Qld 4883, Australia.",john.ludwig@csiro.au,"James, Craig/D-7001-2011; Ludwig, John/D-4686-2011; Bastin, Gary/A-2945-2011; Noojipady, Praveen/B-2511-2010","Bastin, Gary/0000-0002-5583-1368;",NA,NA,NA,70,72,74,2,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,NA,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,FEB,2004,29,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,108,120,NA,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2004.01349.x,NA,NA,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,801JC,WOS:000220091200012,NA,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

Previous studies of the Medium Ground Finch, Geospiza fortis, have documented that selection is most severe under drought conditions, which generally favour beaks that are comparatively deep and narrow. Deep beaks are presumed to enhance a bird's ability to crack hard seeds, and narrow beaks have been proposed to enhance a bird's efficiency in manipulating seeds. 2. In the present study, we make the first direct measurements of bite force in Darwin's finches. We used 147 G. fortis from Isla Santa Cruz, Galapagos, to document the influence of beak, head and body dimensions on bite force. 3. Among the various beak dimensions, depth, width and shape were all significant predictors of bite force. Among the various head dimensions, width was the best predictor of bite force. Generally low predictive values of multiple regression models including all morphological variables, as well as positive allometric scaling of bite force on head width, suggest an important additional role for variation in muscle architecture or jaw biomechanics in bite force generation.","Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Grad Program Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada","Herrel, A (corresponding author), Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",aherrel@uia.ua.ac.be,"Herrel, Anthony/C-3712-2013; Hendry, Andrew/C-5765-2008; Podos, Jeff/I-3843-2019","Herrel, Anthony/0000-0003-0991-4434; Hendry, Andrew/0000-0002-4807-6667; Podos, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2546-7999",NA,NA,NA,19,146,152,0,114,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,NA,NA,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The prevailing notion is that this occurs because size, morphology and weaponry determine the relative effectiveness of alternative strategies, and nowhere is this assumption more entrenched than in our view of the basic decision to stay, fight or flee. Here, we use observations of coyote (Canis latrans) packs hunting deer in winter to show that two ungulates of similar size and morphology, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (O. hemionus), use different antipredator strategies when encountered or attacked. Mule deer typically responded by holding their ground and aggressively defending con-specifics, and were at high risk of being attacked and killed if they fled or were undefended. White-tails always fled when pursued or attacked by coyotes. Coyotes pursued fewer white-tails than mule deer they encountered regardless of prey response. Once pursued or attacked, white-tails faced a risk of attack and capture, respectively, that was intermediate between the high and low risk mule deer groups. The overall risk of capture per encounter for white-tails was similar to that facing mule deer that confronted coyotes, which was much lower than risk facing mule deer that fled and were undefended. Contextual variables such as the opportunity to improve one's position by joining another group, moving to rugged terrain, or the presence of companions that are willing to provide defense may explain why a mixed strategy is maintained in mule deer, despite the apparently detrimental effects of flight. These examples illustrate the value of including prey behavior in models of hunting success in so far as prey defenses may not be coupled with differences in size and morphology.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Large Anim Res Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; Univ Lethbridge, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada","Lingle, S (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Large Anim Res Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",susan.lingle@uleth.ca,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,71,83,84,0,51,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,NA,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2002,131,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,154,164,NA,10.1007/s00442-001-0858-4,NA,NA,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,538QD,WOS:000174825800019,28547505,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

Litter size at weaning in a large natural population (mean = 3.51 pups/litter, 248 litters) was significantly lower than the litter size (6 pups) that produced the most offspring surviving to yearling age class. This evidence contradicted Lack's ''optimal litter size'' hypothesis, which predicts that the most productive litter size should approximate the mean. Litter size had no significant effect on the subsequent survival or reproduction of mothers, contrary to the negative effects predicted by the ''cost of reproduction'' hypothesis. Litter success varied among years, and good and bad years for reproduction could be experimentally simulated with food supplementations. However, small samples of the largest litters rendered the ''bad-years'' hypothesis inappropriate for application to our data. Proportional survival of offspring was relatively constant among different litter sizes, contrary to the necessary condition of the ''cliff edge'' hypothesis of a dramatic decrease in survival of young from the largest litters. The data supported the ''individual optimization'' hypothesis most strongly. As predicted, the number of surviving offspring increased with litter size, although in one population the six largest litters (2.4% of 248 litters) suffered reduced success. In natural and food-supplemented populations, changes in maternal body mass were associated with changes in litter size (r = 0.205 to 0.926). Because survival of young remained relatively constant as litter size increased, these correlations resulted in greater offspring success for mothers in better body condition.","SAVANNAH RIVER ECOL LAB, AIKEN, SC 29802 USA; AUBURN UNIV, ALABAMA AGR EXPT STN, AUBURN, AL 36849 USA; UNIV ALBERTA, DEPT ZOOL, EDMONTON, AB T6G 2E9, CANADA","RISCH, TS (corresponding author), AUBURN UNIV, DEPT ZOOL & WILDLIFE SCI, AUBURN, AL 36849 USA.",NA,"Dobson, F.

Despite the potential competitive advantages, extended leaf duration also subjects non-native species to possible hydraulic risks associated with maintaining leaves during periods of increased frost probability. It remains unclear how non-native species are able to maintain xylem function within this context. Leaf phenology in temperate deciduous trees has been shown to be a function of xylem anatomy, with earlier bud break associated with smaller xylem vessels due to the presumed resistance of smaller vessels to freezing-induced cavitation. We examined relationships between leaf phenology and xylem vessel traits across 82 native and non-native understorey deciduous woody species common to eastern U.S. deciduous forests. We hypothesized that non-native species possess xylem vessel traits associated with maximum hydraulic safety during frost-prone spring and autumn leaf display without compromising rapid growth rate. Larger metaxylem vessels in non-native species were associated with both faster spring growth and delayed autumn leaf fall compared to native species. Non-native species also had smaller latewood vessel diameter, latewood vessel area percentage and a higher proportion of solitary vessels in the entire secondary xylem cross section compared to natives, potentially increasing their resistance to freezing- and/or drought-induced cavitation in autumn, thus allowing for delayed autumn leaf fall. Native and non-native species exhibited similar dates of spring bud break and leaf emergence, consistent with similar xylem vessel size and vessel area percentage within metaxylem and earlywood. Within both groups, species with earlier bud and leaf emergence had a higher total percentage of vessel area within metaxylem and earlywood. This suggests understorey species need sufficient water to support their early spring growth at the risk of freezing-induced cavitation. Our study suggests xylem vessel properties, along with cross-sectional spatial xylem vessel distribution, reflect the capacity of non-native plants to thrive in a new environment and deepen our understanding of the physiological mechanisms of successful invasions of non-native understorey woody plant species.","[Yin, Jingjing; Smith, Maria S.; Bauerle, Taryn L.] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, 134A Plant Sci Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Fridley, Jason D.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, 448 Life Sci Complex, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA","Bauerle, TL (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, 134A Plant Sci Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",bauerle@cornell.edu,NA,NA,Syracuse University,"We thank Meghan Horne for help with embedding and sectioning tissue samples, John Zhao for field help and A.

However, diverse modes of parasite competition (resource-based, antagonism, immunity manipulation) can lead to adaptations with different implications for virulence. Using an experimental evolution approach we investigated the hypothesis that selection in mixed-strain infections will lead to increased antagonism that trades off against investment in virulence. Selection in mixed infections led to improved suppression of competitors in the bacterial insect pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis. Increased antagonism was associated with decreased virulence in three out of four selected lines. Moreover, mixed infections were less virulent than single-strain infections, and between-strain competition tended to decrease pathogen growth in vivo and in vitro. Spiteful interactions among these bacteria may be favoured because of the high metabolic costs of virulence factors and the high risk of mixed infections.","[Garbutt, Jennie; Bonsall, Michael B.; Raymond, Ben] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Math Ecol Res Grp, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Wright, Denis J.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Nat Sci, Div Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Raymond, Ben] Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Raymond, B (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Math Ecol Res Grp, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",ben.raymond@rhul.ac.uk,"Garbutt, Jennie/G-5013-2012; Raymond, Ben/F-5872-2011","Garbutt, Jennie/0000-0002-6148-6847; Bonsall, Michael/0000-0003-0250-0423",BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/C512702/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/E012671/2] Funding Source: researchfish,"This work was supported by BBSRC, NERC and the Royal Society.

Because most moths are nocturnal and easily attracted to lights, the utilization of consistent and uniform sampling methods based on a set of standardized protocols can lead to creation of comparable datasets on regional to global scales. These datasets can be used to address environmental issues such as the biological impacts resulting from climate change and land-use policies. More than 60% of the Korean peninsula is mountainous, and the forests on most mountains are undergoing marked changes related to forest succession and recent climatic variability. Therefore, the present study was conducted to monitor macromoth communities in a mountain ecosystem of Korea. Our study site, Mt. Jirisan National Park is the first national park and the highest mountain on the mainland of South Korea. This mountain range runs 34 km east to west and 26 km north to south, harboring more than 1,400 vascular plant and more than 3,000 insect species. We monitored macromoth communities at six sites in Mt.

The diverse habitats of river Luni support 27 fish species and the highest diversity was recorded from midstream segment (19 species) followed by downstream (14 species). The index of diversity (H' = 2.35) and dominance (D = 0.133) indicated rich fish diversity and even distribution. The relational analysis of habitat variables with abundance of cyprinids revealed, altitude and oxidation reduction potential as the key drivers for its distribution in the upstream segment of the river. This study provides an evidence for establishment of invasive species especially Oreochromis mossambicus and its impact on the fish assemblage structure of arid river Luni. The major anthropogenic factors threatening biodiversity and pristine habitats are mining, release of effluents and excess canal water, unplanned developmental activities in the riparian corridor and establishment of non-native species. The baseline information generated on fish assemblage pattern and habitat status of the river Luni can assist in formulating strategies for the conservation and management of this riverine ecosystem to support the livelihood of local communities.","[Pathak, Ajey Kumar; Kantharajan, G.; Kumar, Ravi; Dayal, Rajesh; Mohindra, Vindhya; Lal, Kuldeep K.] ICAR Natl Bur Fish Genet Resources, Lucknow 226002, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Saini, V.

Comparative studies conducted at multiple locations enable the general importance of processes to be assessed. However, spatial or temporal variation in the strength of local ecological relationships frequently makes it difficult to draw general conclusions, as increasing the extent of a study is likely to increase the physical and biological heterogeneity. To unravel the influence of differences in wave climate on local ecological interactions among adult and juvenile sandflat bivalves, an experiment was conducted at three sites in each of three harbors in the North Island of New Zealand. The selected sites covered a range of wind-wave exposures but were all mid-intertidal sandflats with macrobenthic communities dominated by bivalves. Four treatments were used additions of 0, 15, 45, and 110 adults of the tellinid bivalve Macomona liliana. At each site a DOBIE wave gauge was used to provide time-series data on wave orbital speed at the seabed over the 35-d duration of the experiment. Significant experiment x location interactions indicated site-dependent variation in the strength and direction of treatment effects. However, multiple regression models based on site environmental characteristics were very successful in explaining differences between sites in the strength of experimental treatment effects (66-99% of the variance explained). We used the cube of the orbital wave velocity at the seabed (U-b(3)) as an index of energy dissipation by waves. Both the site average and maximum U-b(3) were important variables explaining location-dependent treatment effects. Average U-b(3) increased the strength of the negative effects of experimental additions of adult Macomona on juvenile bivalves, presumably by increasing the opportunity for juvenile bivalves to be resuspended by small waves and transported away from areas with high adult densities. Maximum U-b(3) decreased the strength of the experimental effects, probably by increasing the purely passive transport of juveniles with sediment bedload and thus obliterating patterns in the distribution of juvenile bivalves relative to adult Macomona. Hence, different aspects of the wave climate influenced adult-juvenile interactions in different ways. Ambient density of adult Macomona around the experimental sites was also an important factor. This multisite experiment confirmed the importance of local adult-juvenile interactions and suggested ways in which these interactions are influenced by local environmental characteristics. Where the influence of such broad-scale variables can be identified, linking broad-scale information to small-scale studies that identify mechanisms can increase the generality of ecological experiments.","Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Hamilton, New Zealand; Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Auckland, New Zealand","Thrush, SF (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, POB 11-115, Hamilton, New Zealand.",NA,"Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012","Thrush, Simon/0000-0002-4005-3882; Cummings, Vonda/0000-0003-1076-3995",NA,NA,NA,96,76,77,1,25,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,NA,NA,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2000,81,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,399,415,NA,10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0399:TGOFEI]2.0.CO;2,NA,NA,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,279ZM,WOS:000085077200010,NA,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

We explored these hypotheses using experimental studies in both field and controlled conditions. Our experiments examined intraspecific effects of seed mass on seedling demography in eight sympatric woody species of Psychotria. We compared the effects of seed mass on seedling size (biomass), maximum relative growth rate (RGR), the proportion of emerged seedlings that survived until one year of age, and the proportion of Sown seeds reaching the stage of one-year-old seedlings in gaps compared with shaded rain forest habitats, as well as in contrasting greenhouse, light conditions. For each species, seeds were classified into four seed mass categories and introduced to three pairs of shaded forest gap sites. In the greenhouse, emerged seedlings from different seed mass categories were grown in contrasting light environments. A positive effect of seed mass on seedling survival was observed in six of seven species in the shaded forest but only in two species in gaps. Final seedling biomass was positively related to seed mass in five species in the shaded forest, but only in two species in gaps. In some species,RGR decreased with seed mass. Consequently, the biomass achieved by small-seeded seedlings with relatively fast growth rates was similar to that of seedlings derived from large seeds. The probability of recruitment increased with seed mass in four of seven species in the shaded forest, but only in two species in gaps. Negative effects of seed mass on recruitment occurred only in one species, and only in gaps. The positive effects of seed mass on seedling biomass and survival observed under shaded greenhouse conditions were weaker than those observed in the shaded forest. Overall, our results indicate that: (1) seed mass influences recruitment in natural forest habitats, (2) larger seeds confer higher probability of recruitment in the shaded forest by producing seedlings with larger size and higher probability of survival, and (3) in natural habitats ecological factors in addition to light (e.g., seed predators) operated selectively on seedlings emerging from seeds differing in mass.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Recursos Nat, Morelia 58089, Michoacan, Mexico; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Paz, H (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Recursos Nat, Apartado Postal 27-3 Xangari, Morelia 58089, Michoacan, Mexico.",hpaz@ate.oikos.unam.mx,"Martinez-Ramos, Miguel/G-8451-2019","Martinez-Ramos, Miguel/0000-0002-7785-1917; Paz, Horacio/0000-0001-5221-0905",NA,NA,NA,47,79,94,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,NA,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2003,84,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,439,450,NA,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0439:SMASPW]2.0.CO;2,NA,NA,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,654FB,WOS:000181482600017,NA,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

Since crossing distance is an attribute of a specific combination of parents, its effect on seed set represents an interaction of these parents, and since genetic similarity declines with physical distance in D. nelsonii populations, the interaction reflects parental genetic similarity. Understanding processes responsible for the effect is simplified if seed set differences result from prezygotic events, because in this case no inbreeding or outbreeding depression are involved. In 1990 we observed pollen tubes after performing crosses between plants separated by 1 m, 10 m, or 100 m, and found that the intermediate, 10 m crosses delivered the most tubes to the ovary. A combined analysis of the 1990 experiment and three earlier experiments showed that this prezygotic difference in performance is significant and of the same magnitude as seed set differences. Disproportionate failure of pollen tubes in 1 and 100 m crosses seems likely to reflect a trait of the maternal parent rather than of pollen, because the kinship of haploid pollen to a zygote it has fertilized always exceeds maternal kinship to that zygote. Thus the conditions for ''pollen suicide'' to evolve by natural selection are more restrictive than those for ''female choice'' to evolve, and the latter is more likely to control the outcome of the parental interaction.","ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA","WASER, NM (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF RIVERSIDE, DEPT BIOL, RIVERSIDE, CA 92521 USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,45,60,60,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,NA,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,1993,68,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,303,308,NA,10.2307/3544843,NA,NA,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MJ666,WOS:A1993MJ66600014,NA,NA,NA,NA,2021-09-23,NA

The duration of an outbreak is expected to depend on the subsequent development of this abundance; however, prediction is nontrivial due to the complexity of the gerbil-plague system. The aim of this study was to investigate how the duration of outbreaks depends on different types of host population dynamics generated from: a cyclic model; an autoregressive model giving irregular fluctuations; and a simple model with uncorrelated fluctuations. For each model, outbreak duration was studied under various levels of mean and variability of host abundance. Its focus on the effect of different gerbil dynamics sets this study apart from the few published studies on diseases in dynamic host populations. Plague outbreaks were simulated in a cellular automaton model based on statistical analysis of archived records of plague and host abundance. Temporal autocorrelation was found to make outbreak duration less sensitive to changes in mean abundance than uncorrelated fluctuations. Cyclicity had little effect on the mean duration of outbreaks, but resulted in a multimodal distribution. For all three types of gerbil dynamics, increased variability in gerbil abundance reduced the duration of outbreaks when the mean abundance was high (paralleling results on the risk of species extinction in fluctuating environments), but increased their duration when the mean abundance was lower. Spatial heterogeneity was briefly tested and produced longer outbreaks than the homogenous case.

However, little is known about changes of bacterial community among the microfeatures within thermokarst area. Results: We investigated bacterial communities using the Illumina sequencing method and examined their relationships with soil parameters in a thermokarst feature on the northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We categorized the ground surface into three different micro-relief patches based on the type and extent of permafrost collapse (control, collapsing and subsided areas). Permafrost collapse significantly decreased the soil carbon density and moisture content in the upper 10 cm samples in the collapsing areas. The highest loading factors for the first principal component (PC) extracted from the soil parameters were soil carbon and nitrogen contents, while soil moisture content and C:N ratios were the highest loading factors for the second PC. The relative abundance of Acidobacteria decreased with depth. Bacterial diversity in subsided areas was higher than that in control areas. Conclusions: Bacterial community structure was significantly affected by pH and depth. The relative abundance of Gemmatimonadetes and Firmicutes were significantly correlated with the first and second PCs extracted from multiple soil parameters, suggesting these phyla could be used as indicators for the soil parameters in the thermokarst terrain.","[Wu, Xiaodong; Zhao, Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resource, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Cryosphere Res Stn Qinghai Tibetan Plateau, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Haiyan; Liu, Guimin] Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Environm & Municipal Engn, Lanzhou 730070, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Mu, Cuicui] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Western Chinas Environm Syst, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China","Wu, XD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resource, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Cryosphere Res Stn Qinghai Tibetan Plateau, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",wuxd@lzb.ac.cn,"Zhao, Lin/M-9536-2018; mu, cuicui/AAU-2733-2020","Zhao, Lin/0000-0003-0245-8413; mu, cuicui/0000-0003-0630-9423","State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences [SKLCS-ZZ-2018]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41721091, 41661013, 41871060, 41601063]; CASChinese Academy of Sciences [QYZDY-SSW-DQC021]; Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities of China [lzujbky-2017-223]","This work was financially supported by the State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences (SKLCS-ZZ-2018), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41721091, 41661013, 41871060, 41601063).

In this study, we used ingrowth cores to investigate the impacts of regular rotation of the cores, defaunation and nitrogen addition on AMF, microbial biomass and microarthropods in the fermentation/humus (F/H) and litter (L) layers of an Ecuadorian montane tropical rainforest. AMF were substantially reduced in the F/H layer (to 34% of initial), while in the L layer they remained constant during the experiment. Overall, microorganisms and microarthropods were largely independent of AMF hyphae and their exudates, however, defaunation strongly affected the recovery of their communities. Nitrogen addition increased the quality of litter material and beneficially affected microbial communities thereby increasing decomposition rates, but did not impact AMF abundance and microarthropod communities. These findings suggest that the cutoff of the carbon supply from the plant to the fungal mycelium was not compensated by switching resources in the F/H layer, underlining a strong association between AMF and living roots. While in the L layer, AMF likely competed with saprotrophic microorganisms for litter-derived resources at intermediate stages of decomposition pointing to indirect contributions of AMF to decomposition processes. Overall, the results support the view that root-derived resources are important in fueling soil food webs, but also indicate that in the studied montane rainforest these resources are only available close to roots and not channeled distant to roots via AMF.","[Sanchez-Galindo, Laura M.; Maraun, Mark; Scheu, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, Gottingen, Germany; [Camenzind, Tessa] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Berlin, Germany; [Scheu, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use, Gottingen, Germany","Sanchez-Galindo, LM (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, Gottingen, Germany.",lsanche@uni-goettingen.de,NA,"Sanchez-Galindo, Laura M./0000-0002-6403-8329",NA,NA,NA,94,4,4,2,19,SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS,JODHPUR,"5A, NEW PALI RD, JODHPUR, RAJASTHAN 342 001, INDIA",0564-3295,2661-8982,NA,TROP ECOL,Trop.
