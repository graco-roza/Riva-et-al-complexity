Ecological complexity has been linked to concepts such as ecological integrity, diversity and resilience and has been put forth as a candidate ecological orientor. In this article, the concept of complexity as a system attribute is presented and candidate measures of ecological complexity are reviewed. The measures are distinguished by their ability to characterize the spatial, temporal, structural or spatiotemporal signatures of an ecosystem. Many of these measures have been adapted from disciplines such as physics and information theory that have a long history of quantifying complexity, however more work needs to be clone to develop techniques adapted to ecological data. It is argued that if appropriate measures are developed and validated for ecosystems, ecological complexity could become a key ecological indicator. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

After considering the five values orientations offered by Jewett, Bain, and Ennis, the authors conclude that ecological integration offers a useful starting point in this regard, but taking this a step further, they offer a worldview that they call ecological complexity, woven together from social constructivism, complexity, and ecological thinking. Since the authors argue that teachers who espouse this worldview focus on emergent learning, they have coined the term emergent learning focused (ELF) teacher to describe the pedagogical approaches that might result. These encourage the spontaneous play seen in the schoolyard, playground, or village green as opposed to work in the factory. ELF teachers encourage learners to develop holistically as they construct meaning, positioning themselves in the ecosphere of which they form an integral part. The authors apply ecological complexity to Inventing Games, in which learners invent and refine games within the TGfU classifications. They argue that as learners work together to invent and develop ownership of their games, they engage in a cognitive apprenticeship that prepares them for life in the wider community. Specifically, learners develop core social and emotional learning skills in a process that the authors have termed situated ethics. As game play structures and constraints work in balance to produce disturbances, learners adapt and game play evolves. Learners learn to navigate these adaptations and evolutions by creating sustainable democratic processes. Teachers who operate from an ecological complexity worldview see all educational agents-learners, teachers, administrators, curriculum, school, community, and culture-as parts of a sustainable learning system. The authors conclude by offering the building blocks they believe might move this system closer to sustainability in games education.","[Butler, Joy I.] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Storey, Brian] Douglas Coll, New Westminster, BC, Canada; [Robson, Claire] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada","Butler, JI (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Curriculum & Pedag, Fac Educ, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",joy.butler@ubc.ca,,,,,,59,9,9,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1357-3322,1470-1243,,SPORT EDUC SOC,Sport.

These complexities proliferate unpredictably therefore investigating and supporting the ability of public agencies to respond effectively is increasingly important. However, understanding how public NRM agencies innovate and restructure to negotiate the range of particular complexities they face is an under researched field. One particular conceptualisation of the social-ecological complexities facing NRM agencies that is of growing influence is the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus. Yet, as a tool to frame and understand those complexities it has limitations. Specifically, it overlooks how NRMs respond institutionally to these social-ecological complexities in the context of economic and organisational challenges-thus creating a gap in the literature. Current debates in public administration can be brought to bear here. Using an organisational cultures approach, this paper reports on a case study with a national NRM agency to investigate how they are attempting to transform institutionally to respond to complexity in challenging times. The research involved 12 elite interviews with senior leaders from Natural Resources Wales, (NRW) and investigated how cultural narratives are being explicitly and implicitly constructed and mobilised to this end. The research identified four distinct and sequential cultural narratives: collaboration, communication, trust, and empowerment where each narrative supported the delivery of different dimensions of NRW's social-ecological complexity mandate. Counter to the current managerialist approaches in public administration, these results suggest that the empowerment of expert bureaucrats is important in responding effectively to complexity.","[Kirsop-Taylor, Nick A.; Scott, Karen] Univ Exeter, Polit Dept, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England; [Hejnowicz, Adam P.] Univ York, Dept Biol, Wentworth Way, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","Kirsop-Taylor, NA (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Polit Dept, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England.",n.a.kirsop-taylor@exeter.ac.uk,,"Kirsop-Taylor, Nicholas/0000-0003-4247-5971","Centre for the Evaluation of Complexity Across the Nexus, a UK Economic and Social Research Council large centre [ES/N012550/1]; Natural Resources Wales","This paper was funded through a Research Fellowship from The Centre for the Evaluation of Complexity Across the Nexus, a UK Economic and Social Research Council large centre [ES/N012550/1].

Individual soniferous species, the acoustic community, and soundscape are the three main operational levels that comprise this multi-layer network. Acoustic adaptation and acoustic niche are two more important mechanisms that regulate the acoustic performances at the first level while the acoustic community model explains the complexity of the interspecific acoustic network at the second level. Acoustic habitat and ecoacoustic events are two of the most relevant mechanisms that operate at the third level. The exchange of ecoacoustic information on each of these levels is assured by ecoacoustic codes. At the level of individual sonifeorus species, a dyadic intraspecific exchange of information is established between an emitter and a receiver. Ecoacoustic codes discriminate, identify, and label specific signals that pertain to the theme, variation, motif repetition, and intensity of signals. At the acoustic community level, a voluntarily or involuntarily communication is established between networks of interspecific emitters and receivers. Ecoacoustic codes at this level transmit information (e.g., recognition of predators, location of food sources, availability and location of refuges) between one species and the acoustically interacting community and impart cohesion to interspecific assemblages. At the soundscape level, acoustic information is transferred from a mosaic of geophonies, biophonies, and technophonies to different species that discriminate meaningful ecoacoustic events and their temporal dynamics during habitat selection processes. Ecoacoustic codes at this level operate on a limited set of signals from the environmental acoustic dynamic that are heterogeneous in time and space, and these codes are interpreted differently according to the species during habitat selection and the completion of phenological cycles. The process of ecoacoustic coding can be interpreted according to the eco-field theory, which describes the procedures utilized by a receiver to intercept and optimize acoustic information. The acoustic codes may be detected and identified using mathematical models that simulate their performances. The Acoustic Complexity Indices are an appropriate tool to investigate the acoustic codes in action on all three levels. Ecoacoustic codes are powerful agencies used by sound-adapted species to cope with environmental novelties, and their efficiency may represent an important divide between whether a species perpetuates or becomes extinct.

In order to study complexity or factor it into our theories or models, a better understanding of complexity is needed. Complexity has at least six dimensions in ecology: spatial, temporal, structural, process, behavioral, and geometric. These six sources of complexity are discussed. Issues and approaches to the study of complexity are also discussed. It is argued that our vocabulary for describing complexity is deficient in many areas. Scaling is a successful technique that has been used to simplify complex relationships. Model reduction is shown to be a powerful technique that applies when either ensembles of objects behave as aggregate wholes or conservation laws constrain overall behaviors. It is argued that experimental frames need more attention when dealing with complex ecosystem attributes. Life history theory and metapopulation models are two areas where further development of the subject depends on the ability to handle complexity properly.

Though not commonly viewed as such, metaphors are an indispensable component of science, and should not be appraised as true or false, but rather in terms of how they help or hinder knowledge.

Despite of its wide use, it has received different definitions not always coincident. Such ambiguity is still more evident in its quantitative characterization. Most of the available methods are heavily context dependent and often difficult to apply in the practice. Here, we propose to define and calculate resilience starting from the data matrices resulting from multivariate measurements of different biological metrics. The resilience between two field scenarios (each one characterized by their corresponding datasets) can be conveniently captured as the difference between its respective data complexities. Complexity is quantified by means of the entropy associated to the spectral distribution of the singular values of each data matrix. The method proposed has been illustrated with a case study in which the resilience of a river (Ebro River, NE Spain) is calculated comparing six biological metrics associated to the phytoplankton, upstream and downstream to a series of large reservoirs that alter the natural river flow regime.

A 'simple' model assumes that most, if not all, Ediacaran organisms shared similar basic ecologies. A contrasting 'complex' model suggests that the Ediacara biota more likely represent organisms from a variety of different positions on the eukaryotic tree and thus occupied a wide range of different ecologies. We perform a quantitative test of Ediacaran ecosystem complexity using rank abundance distributions (RADs). We show that the Ediacara biota formed complex-type communities throughout much of their stratigraphic range and thus likely comprised species that competed for different resources and/or created niche for others ('ecosystem engineers'). One possible explanation for this pattern rests in the recent inference of multiple metazoan-style feeding modes among the Ediacara biota; in this scenario, different Ediacaran groups/clades were engaged in different methods of nutrient collection and thus competed for different resources.

Nestedness in mutualistic ecological networks is the tendency for ecological specialists to interact with a subset of species that also interact with more generalist species(2). Recent mathematical and computational analysis has suggested that such nestedness increases species richness(3,4). By examining previous results and applying computational approaches to 59 empirical data sets representing mutualistic plant-pollinator networks, we show that this statement is incorrect. A simpler metric-the number of mutualistic partners a species has-is a much better predictor of individual species survival and hence, community persistence. Nestedness is, at best, a secondary covariate rather than a causative factor for biodiversity in mutualistic communities. Analysis of complex networks should be accompanied by analysis of simpler, underpinning mechanisms that drive multiple higher-order network properties.","[James, Alex; Plank, Michael J.] Univ Canterbury, Biomath Res Ctr, Christchurch 8040, New Zealand; [Pitchford, Jonathan W.] Univ York, York Ctr Complex Syst Anal, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Pitchford, Jonathan W.] Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Pitchford, Jonathan W.] Univ York, Dept Math, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","James, A (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Biomath Res Ctr, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8040, New Zealand.",alex.james@canterbury.ac.nz,"Plank, Michael John/H-8030-2019","Plank, Michael John/0000-0002-7539-3465; James, Alex/0000-0002-1543-7139",Royal Society of New ZealandRoyal Society of New Zealand [08-UOC-034]; University of Canterbury,"We thank D.

In these highly populated areas, multiple actors, interests, and activities coexist, leading to intensified conflicts between stakeholders. The research presented here aims to understand how coastal social-ecological complexity is studied within coastal ES literature. A systematic review of the literature consisting of 199 manuscripts was performed using the PRISMA method (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). The results show that coastal ES research has been focused on understanding ecological processes for ES provision and value. Hence, coastal ES studies fall short of considering the social components and social-ecological interactions of coastal systems: ES flows, demand, coproduction, power relations, institutions and governance, temporal and spatial scales, value pluralism, uncertainty, and human well-being multidimensions and distribution. The partial integration of social-ecological complexity within coastal ES research limits coastal ES management because nonlinear interactions among social and ecological components are not well understood, particularly stakeholders' relations, their roles, and the links to ES. Finally, we propose a conceptual framework that integrates the gaps identified during the review. The framework places coproduction and power relations as the core factors of assessments of coastal ES, as means to understand complex, nonlinear social-ecological interactions and feedback processes. Hence, it also provides necessary tools to address normative issues of coastal management such as control, access, trade-offs, and benefits.","[Sole, Liliana; Ariza, Eduard] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Geog, Barcelona, Spain","Sole, L (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Geog, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Sole, Liliana/AAB-3030-2020",,POLICLIMA project [CSO2016-76842-C2-1-R]; Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris [FI-2017]; Ramon y Cajal contract from the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [RYC-2013-13392],This research was carried out under the framework of POLICLIMA project (CSO2016-76842-C2-1-R).

While great strides have been made in the last half century in understanding rivers as ecological systems, human exploitation of river water and riparian zones have frustrated river management to the point that many native species are imperiled or have become extinct, invasive species are rampant, water and sediment quality are in significant decline, environmental flows are neglected, and economic pressures are placing unprecedented demands on remaining resources. At the same time, there are societal expectations that river resources be restored or rehabilitated(1) to functional states, even while climate change, population growth, flow diversion, and the proliferation of chemicals impose additional burdens in ways that are not adequately understood. Therein lies one of the great challenges of this century. Can river systems be realistically restored or rehabilitated and, if so, what are the approaches and scales that have a chance of being successful? The 2013 E. Baldi lecture addresses these questions by examining 2 examples of river restoration: identifying socio-ecological attributes from those examples that have been successful as well as aspects needing improvement, and presenting principles for improving river restoration in highly complex situations. The principles are designed to enhance resilience and promote adaptive capacity within social-ecological systems-systems that continue to evolve.","[Naiman, Robert J.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Naiman, Robert J.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Excellence Nat Resource Management, Albany, WA 6330, Australia","Naiman, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",naiman@uw.edu,,,"University of Western Australia, through the Centre of Excellence in Natural Resource Management (CENRM)","Peter M.

Most studies of plant virus host range evolution have focused on the genetics of host-pathogen interactions. However, the distribution and abundance of plant viruses and their hosts do not always overlap, and these spatial and temporal discontinuities in plant virus-host interactions can result in various ecological processes that shape host range evolution. Recent work shows that the distributions of pathogenic and resistant genotypes, vectors, and other resources supporting transmission vary widely in the environment, producing both expected and unanticipated patterns. The distributions of all of these factors are influenced further by competitive effects, natural enemies, anthropogenic disturbance, the abiotic environment, and herbivory to mention some. We suggest the need for further development of approaches that (i) explicitly consider resource use and the abiotic and biotic factors that affect the strategies by which viruses exploit resources; and (ii) are sensitive across scales. Host range and habitat specificity will largely determine which phyla are most likely to be new hosts, but predicting which host and when it is likely to be infected is enormously challenging because it is unclear how environmental heterogeneity affects the interactions of viruses and hosts.","[McLeish, Michael J.; Fraile, Aurora; Garcia-Arenal, Fernando] Univ Politecn Madrid, Ctr Biotecnol & Genom Plantas UPM INIA, Campus Montegancedo, Madrid, Spain; [McLeish, Michael J.; Fraile, Aurora; Garcia-Arenal, Fernando] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSI Agr Alimentaria & Biosistemas, Campus Montegancedo, Madrid, Spain","Garcia-Arenal, F (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Ctr Biotecnol & Genom Plantas UPM INIA, Campus Montegancedo, Madrid, Spain.; Garcia-Arenal, F (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSI Agr Alimentaria & Biosistemas, Campus Montegancedo, Madrid, Spain.",fernando.garciaarenal@upm.es,,,,,,294,17,17,1,12,ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0065-3527,,978-0-12-814415-2,ADV VIRUS RES,Adv.Virus Res.,,2018,101,,,,,,293,339,,,,47,Virology,Virology,BL5OG,29908592,,,,9/23/21,,,

It is generally thought that scientific knowledge is able to complement farmers' knowledge. However, for this collaboration to be fruitful, the gap between the knowledge frameworks of both farmers and scientists will need to be closed. We report on the learning results of 14 workshops held in Chiapas, Mexico during 2015 in which 117 small-scale coffee farmers of all genders (30% women) and ages who had little schooling were exposed by researchers to a natural history narrative, a multispecies network representation, a board game, and a series of graphical quizzes, all related to a nine-species complex ecological network with potential for autonomous control of the ongoing and devastating coffee rust epidemic that was affecting them. Farmers' retention and understanding of direct and indirect bilateral interactions among organisms was assessed with different methods to elucidate the effect of adding Azteca Chess gaming sessions to a detailed and very graphical lecture. Evaluation methods that were better adapted to farmers' conditions improved learning scores and showed statistically significant age effect (players older than 40 had lower retention scores) and gaming effect (lower retention of interactions included in the lecture but not in the game). The combination of lecture and game sessions helped participants better understand cascades of trait-mediated interactions. Participants' debriefings confirmed qualitatively that they learned that beneficial organisms and interactions occur on their farms, and that gaming was enjoyable, motivating, and critical to grasp complex interactions. Many of the farmers concluded that the outcome of these interactions is not unique and not always in favor of rust control but is context dependent. Many concluded that there are feasible things they can do on their farms, derived from what they learned, to favor potential autonomous pest control.","[Garcia-Barrios, Luis] El Colegio Frontera Sur, San Cristobal de las Casa, Chis, Mexico; [Cruz-Morales, Juana] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Campus Chiapas, Texcoco, Mexico; [Vandermeer, John] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Perfecto, Ivette] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Garcia-Barrios, L (corresponding author), El Colegio Frontera Sur, San Cristobal de las Casa, Chis, Mexico.",luis.garciabarrios@gmail.com,,,NSF/OPUS [1144923]; ECOSUR's special grant,"We thank workshop participants from the Sepultura and Tacana territories (Sierra Madre de Chiapas), and Baldemar Zacarias Mejia, Benigno Gomez Gomez, and Gustavo Lopez Bautista for their enthusiastic collaboration.

The focus is the Canada goose (Branta canadensis) hunt which is adaptive to shifts and changes in local and regional conditions. Ecological understandings of Cree hunters allow them to account for and deal with a very large number of variables at multiples scales. The Cree deal with these variables qualitatively, an approach consistent with some scientific ways of dealing with complexity, such as adaptive management and fuzzy logic.","[Peloquin, Claude; Berkes, Fikret] Univ Manitoba, Nat Resources Inst, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Peloquin, C (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Nat Resources Inst, 303-70 Dysart Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",umpeloqc@cc.umanitoba.ca,,,,,,56,64,67,0,61,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0300-7839,1572-9915,,HUM ECOL,Hum.

It shares with ecosystem ecology the primate of emergent ecological disciplines. The aim of this contribution is to approach the definition of landscapes using cognitive paradigms. Neutral-based landscape (NbL), individual-based landscape (IbL) and observed-based landscape (ObL) are, defined to explore the cognitive mechanisms. NbL represents the undecoded component of the cognitive matrix. The IbL is the portion of landscape perceived by the biological sensors. ObL is the part of the cognitive matrix perceived using the cultural background of the observer. The perceived landscape (PL) is composed by the sum of these three approaches of landscape perception. Two further types of information (sensu Stonier) are recognized in this process of perception: the compressed information, as it is present inside the cognitive matrix, and the decompressed information that will structure the PL when a semiotic relationship operates between the organisms and the cognitive matrix. Scaling properties of these three PL components are recognized in space and time. In NbL scale seems irrelevant, in IbL the perception is filtered by organismic scaling and in ObL the spatio-temporal scale seems of major importance. Definitively, perception is seal e-dependent.

The consistency of relationships between corals and specific prokaryotes, however, is debated, and the locations where microbially mediated processes occur in the host are not resolved. Here, we examined how the prokaryotic associates of five common Caribbean corals with different evolutionary and ecological traits differ across mucus and tissue habitats. We used physical and chemical separation of coral mucus and tissue and sequencing of partial small-subunit rRNA genes of bacteria and archaea from these samples to demonstrate that coral tissue and mucus harbor unique reservoirs of prokaryotes, with 23 to 49% and 31 to 56% of sequences exclusive to the tissue and mucus habitats, respectively. Across all coral species, we found that 46 tissue-and 22 mucus-specific microbial members consistently associated with the different habitats. Sequences classifying as Candidatus Amoebophilus, Bacteroidetes-affiliated intracellular symbionts of amoebae, emerged as previously unrecognized tissue associates of three coral species. This study demonstrates how coral habitat differentiation enables highly resolved examination of ecological interactions between corals and their associated microorganisms and identifies previously unrecognized tissue and mucus associates of Caribbean corals for future targeted study. IMPORTANCE This study demonstrates that coral tissue or mucus habitats structure the microbiome of corals and that separation of these habitats facilitates identification of consistent microbial associates. Using this approach, we demonstrated that sequences related to  Candidatus Amoebophilus, recognized intracellular symbionts of amoebae, were highly associated with the tissues of Caribbean corals and possibly endosymbionts of a protistan host within corals, adding a further degree of intricacy to coral holobiont symbioses. Examining specific habitats within complex hosts such as corals is useful for targeting important microbial associations that may otherwise be masked by the sheer microbial diversity associated with all host habitats.","[Apprill, Amy; Weber, Laura G.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Santoro, Alyson E.] Univ Maryland, Horn Point Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Cambridge, MD USA; [Santoro, Alyson E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Apprill, A (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",aapprill@whoi.edu,"Santoro, Alyson E/E-5686-2013","Santoro, Alyson E/0000-0003-2503-8219",National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-1233612]; Dalio Explore Award,This work was funded by a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant (OCE-1233612) to A.

Rewilding has gained increasing attention from scientists, conservationists and the mass-media. Yet, it has raised highly divergent perspectives as to which ecological processes and species assemblages should be restored. Here we argue that a pragmatic and immediate approach to rewilding unequivocally focused on preserving and restoring the structural and functional complexity of ecosystems must become a primary component of biodiversity conservation. We propose a process-oriented formulation of the rewilding hypothesis as a general guide to assess the conservation benefits of reverting defaunation. Finally, we identify the need for a framework where the benefits, risks, and costs of rewilding can be evaluated in relation to restoration baselines and the intensity of interventions required to achieve conservation goals.","[Fernandez, Nestor; Navarro, Laetitia M.; Pereira, Henrique M.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Fernandez, Nestor] Spanish Natl Res Council, EBD, CSIC, Americo Vespucio Sn, Seville 41092, Spain; [Navarro, Laetitia M.; Pereira, Henrique M.] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany","Fernandez, N (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",nestor.fernandez@idiv.de,"Navarro, Laetitia/O-9765-2019; Navarro, Laetitia M./U-1899-2017; Fernandez, Nestor/AAA-3523-2020; Pereira, Henrique Miguel/B-3975-2009; Fernandez, Nestor/N-5802-2014","Navarro, Laetitia/0000-0003-1099-5147; Navarro, Laetitia M./0000-0003-1099-5147; Pereira, Henrique Miguel/0000-0003-1043-1675; Fernandez, Nestor/0000-0002-9645-8571",,,,6,37,38,1,74,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1755-263X,,,CONSERV LETT,Conserv.

However, there are general statistical patterns emerging on particular spatial and temporal scales, which indicate the existence of some universal principles behind many ecological phenomena, and which can even be used for the prediction of phenomena occurring on finer scales of resolution. These generalities comprise regular frequency distributions of particular macroscopic variables within higher taxa (body size, abundance, range size), relationships between such variables, and general patterns in species richness. All the patterns are closely related to each other and although there are only a few major explanatory principles, there are plenty of alternative explanations. Reconciliation of different approaches cannot be obtained without careful formulation of testable hypotheses and rigorous quantitative empirical research. Two especially promising ways of untangling ecological complexity comprise: (1) analysis of invariances, i.e. universal quantitative relationships observed within many different systems, and (2) detailed analysis of the anatomy of macroecological phenomena, i.e. explorations of how emergent multispecies patterns are related to regular patterns concerning individual species.

Understanding how diversity responds to environmental perturbations and the consequences of this relationship for ecosystem function are thus central challenges in microbial ecology. Unimodal diversity-disturbance relationships, in which maximum diversity occurs at intermediate levels of disturbance, have been predicted for ecosystems where life history tradeoffs separate organisms along a disturbance gradient. However, empirical support for such peaked relationships in macrosystems is mixed, and few studies have explored these relationships in microbial systems. Here we use complex microbial microcosm communities to systematically determine diversity-disturbance relationships over a range of disturbance regimes. We observed a reproducible switch between community states, which gave rise to transient diversity maxima when community states were forced to mix. Communities showed reduced compositional stability when diversity was highest. To further explore these dynamics, we formulated a simple model that reveals specific regimes under which diversity maxima are stable. Together, our results show how both unimodal and non-unimodal diversity-disturbance relationships can be observed as a system switches between two distinct microbial community states; this process likely occurs across a wide range of spatially and temporally heterogeneous microbial ecosystems. IMPORTANCE The diversity of microbial communities is linked to the functioning and stability of ecosystems. As humanity continues to impact ecosystems worldwide, and as diet and disease perturb our own commensal microbial communities, the ability to predict how microbial diversity will respond to disturbance is of critical importance. Using microbial microcosm experiments, we find that community diversity responds to different disturbance regimes in a reproducible and predictable way. Maximum diversity occurs when two communities, each suited to different environmental conditions, are mixed due to disturbance. This maximum diversity is transient except under specific regimes. Using a simple mathematical model, we show that transient unimodality is likely a common feature of microbial diversity-disturbance relationships in fluctuating environments.","[Gibbons, Sean M.; Scholz, Monika; Hutchison, Alan L.; Dinner, Aaron R.; Gilbert, Jack A.; Coleman, Maureen L.] Univ Chicago, Grad Program Biophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Gibbons, Sean M.; Gilbert, Jack A.] Argonne Natl Lab, Inst Genom & Syst Biol, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Hutchison, Alan L.] Univ Chicago, Med Scientist Training Program, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Dinner, Aaron R.] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, 5735 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Scholz, Monika; Dinner, Aaron R.] Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, 5640 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Gilbert, Jack A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 940 E 57Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Gilbert, Jack A.] Marine Biol Lab, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Gilbert, Jack A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Surg, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Coleman, Maureen L.] Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, 5734 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Gibbons, Sean M.] MIT, Dept Biol Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Gibbons, SM (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Grad Program Biophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.; Gibbons, SM (corresponding author), Argonne Natl Lab, Inst Genom & Syst Biol, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.; Gibbons, SM (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Biol Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",sean.gibbons@fulbrightmail.org,"Gibbons, Sean M./ABH-2562-2020; Gilbert, Jack/AAF-3270-2019; Hutchison, Alan L/B-5769-2015","Gibbons, Sean M./0000-0002-8724-7916; Hutchison, Alan L/0000-0003-4161-0772; Coleman, Maureen/0000-0001-5065-0106; Scholz, Monika/0000-0003-2186-410X","HHS | National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [5T-32EB-009412, T32GM07281]; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [PHY-1305542]; EPA STAR graduate fellowshipUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; HHMI International Student Research Fellowship; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB) [T32EB009412] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM007281] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Direct For Mathematical & Physical ScienNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1305542] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work, including the efforts of Sean M.

CL is responsible for more than 1000 reported cases per year in Ecuador. Vector collection studies in Ecuador suggest that there is a strong association between the ecological diversity of an ecosystem, the presence of potential alternative or reservoir hosts and the abundance of sand fly species. Data collected from a coastal community in Ecuador showed that Leishmania parasites may be circulating in diverse hosts, including mammalian and potentially avian species, and these hosts may serve as potential hosts for the parasite. There has been limited reporting of CL cases in Ecuador because the disease is non-fatal and its surveillance system is passive. Hence, the actual incidence of CL is unknown. In this study, an epidemic model was developed and analysed to understand the complexity of CL transmission dynamics with potential non-human hosts in the coastal ecosystem and to estimate critical epidemiological quantities for Ecuador. The model is fitted to the 2010 CL outbreak in the town of Valle Hermoso in the Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas province of Ecuador and parameters such as CL transmission rates in different types of hosts (primary and alternative), and levels of case reporting in the town are estimated. The results suggest that the current surveillance in this region fails to capture 38% (with 95% CI (29%, 47%)) of the actual number of cases under the assumption that alternative hosts are dead-end hosts and that the mean CL reproduction number in the town is 3.9. This means that on the average 3.9 new human CL cases were generated by a single infectious human in the town during the initial period of the 2010 outbreak. Moreover, major outbreaks of CL in Ecuador in coastal settings are unavoidable until reporting through the surveillance system is improved and alternative hosts are managed properly. The estimated infection transmission probabilities from alternative hosts to sand flies, and sand flies to alternative hosts are 27% and 32%, respectively. The analysis highlights that vector control and alternative host management are two effective programmes for Ecuador but need to be implemented concurrently to avoid future major outbreaks.","[Morales, Diego, V; Cevallos, Varsovia] Inst Nacl Invest Salud Publ INSPI, Quito, Ecuador; [Paredes, Marlio] Univ Valle, Dept Math, Calle 13 100-00, Cali 760032, Colombia; [Cruz-Aponte, Maytee] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Math Phys, Cayey, PR 00736 USA; [Morales-Butler, Emmanuel J.] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Nat Sci, Utuado, PR 00641 USA; [Arriola, Leon] Univ Wisconsin, Math Dept, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA; [Ponce, Patricio] Yachay Tech Univ, San Miguel De Urcuqui, Ecuador; [Paredes, Marlio] Univ Francisco Gavidia, Inst Ciencia Tecnol & Innovac, San Salvador, El Salvador; [Paredes, Marlio; Cevallos, Varsovia; Ponce, Patricio; Mubayi, Anuj] Arizona State Univ, Simon A Levin Math Computat & Modeling Sci Ctr, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Mubayi, Anuj] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Mubayi, A (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Simon A Levin Math Computat & Modeling Sci Ctr, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.; Mubayi, A (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",amubayi@asu.edu,,"Morales, Diego/0000-0002-3663-1782; Paredes, Marlio/0000-0002-9375-3743; Cruz-Aponte, Maytee/0000-0003-2270-2225","National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DMPS-0838705, ACI 1525012, 0014]","This project has been partially supported by A.M.'s grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF, grant no.

Advances in cultivation-independent molecular methods have provided a route to study microbial consortia in their natural surroundings and to begin resolving the community structure, dominant metabolic processes and inter-organism interactions. However, the utility of these methods generally scales inversely with community complexity. By applying genomics-enabled methods to the study of natural microbial communities with reduced levels of species richness, a relatively comprehensive understanding of the metabolic networks and evolutionary processes within these communities can be attained. In such well-defined model systems, it is also possible to link emergent ecological patterns to their molecular and evolutionary underpinnings, facilitating construction of predictive ecosystem models. In this study, we review over a decade of research on one such system-acid mine drainage biofilm communities. We discuss the value and limitations of tractable model microbial communities in developing molecular methods for microbial ecology and in uncovering principles that may explain behavior in more complex systems.

Yet, our understanding of the ecological imprint of ocean acidification (elevated CO2) and climate change (elevated temperature) is largely based on reports of negative effects on single species in simplified laboratory systems(4,5). By combining a large mesocosm experiment with a global meta-analysis, we reveal the capacity of consumers (fish and crustaceans) to resist the impacts of elevated CO2. While individual behaviours were impaired by elevated CO2, consumers could restore their performances in more complex environments that allowed for compensatory processes. Consequently, consumers maintained key traits such as foraging, habitat selection and predator avoidance despite elevated CO2 and sustained their populations. Our observed increase in risk-taking under elevated temperature, however, predicts greater vulnerability of consumers to predation.

Complexity after Rosen [Rosen, R., 2000. Essays on Life Itself. Columbia University Press, New York, p. 257] is something that cannot be modeled. Conventional properties ascribed to complex systems are in fact prescriptions for what it takes to make a complex system yield to a model structure, to make it a simple system, albeit a complicated one. Complexity is not a material property, but turns rather on the question that is posed. It is normative to the degree that complexity arises from the lack of a paradigm, lack of an accepted set of modeling assertions. We develop a scheme for making complexity tractable. Our protocol arises from Pattee [Pattee, H., 1978. The complementarity principle in biological and social structures. J. Soc. Biol.

Contemporary research in ecosystem complexity offers a new platform on which to adjudicate between these two points of view. Through particular network structuring, nonlinearity, and stochasticity, and especially with the added dimension of space, recent theoretical and empirical research reveals that ecological systems persist and generate ecosystem services as a result of complex interacting components.

We evaluate the position of 50 previously published studies of fish and drought with respect to spatial scale of study (individual stream pools to subcontinents), length of the dry period (weeks to centuries), and level of system complexity (individual fish to ecosystems). Most papers address short (months to a year) droughts or dry periods, in local reaches of streams, and impacts on populations or local assemblages. In these 50 papers, the most frequently demonstrated effects of drought were population declines, loss of habitat, changes in the community, negative effects from changes in water quality, movement within catchments, and crowding of fish in reduced microhabitats. Thirteen other less frequent effects also were identified. 2. Gaps in knowledge exist on effects of long-term droughts (decades to centuries), influence of drought on fish effects in ecosystems, and at the spatial scale of river basins to subcontinents. However, some of these gaps have recently been addressed, particularly additive effects of repeated drying episodes and whole-lake or basin-wide effects of drought, and in using molecular techniques to seek signals of drought at wide geographic scales because of events in the deep past. Gaps in knowledge remain for effects of very short dry periods, on drought effects on higher levels of complexity, and on the manner in which droughts at the scale of decades affect fish. 3. Data from streams in Oklahoma and elsewhere in the south-western U.S.A. suggest that most droughts may leave little persistent signal in the existing fish fauna, i.e. that recovery from drought by fish populations or assemblages in the region can be rapid. However, species that are vulnerable to drought or water loss in streams may have disappeared from some basins in the region before the mid-1900s, and recent evidence also suggests that extreme droughts do sometimes alter fish assemblages. 4. Little is known about mechanisms by which droughts have direct or indirect effects on fish, the roles of droughts in the evolution of fish species, and the ways droughts alter effects of fish in ecosystems. Global climate changes may have serious consequences for future local or regional fish faunas, but ongoing studies of fish experiencing drought may aid in future conservation of what will become species at risk under climate-change scenarios.","Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73019 USA; Univ Oklahoma, Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum Nat Hist, Biol Stn, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Matthews, WJ (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",wmatthews@ou.edu,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009",,,,,110,269,276,5,103,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Biodiversity evolved, becoming more and more complex, by a process that went through many patterns of diversification and that is still running. Biodiversity is not teleological, it did not evolve at the present stage to make a proper world for us, or to make ecosystems function; ecosystems functioned also at the dawn of life, when diversity was very low. Ecology and evolution are strictly linked, and both are historical disciplines that involve AA non-linear systems with a clear chaotic development, with the co-existence of strong constraints (in both form and function) and powerful contingencies (like those that caused the mass extinctions of the past). Historical predictions can only be weak, and can be formulated only when trends are identified (i.e. the attractors of chaotic systems). Modem ecology discarded natural history, setting quantitative goals that forced it to remove quality from its vision of complexity. This attitude led to enormous conceptual advances that are starting to show their limits. The identification of trends, set by constraints/attractors, and of deviations from them. due to contingencies, is an ambitious and practicable goal for mature ecology.","Univ Lecce, DiSTeBA, Stn Biol Marina, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; Ist Ambiente Marino Costiero CNR, Sezione Talassografico A Cerruti, I-74100 Taranto, Italy","Boero, F (corresponding author), Univ Lecce, DiSTeBA, Stn Biol Marina, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",,"Boero, Ferdinando/B-4494-2008; Fraschetti, Simonetta/R-8716-2019; Rubino, Fernando/R-9491-2019; Fanelli, Giovanni/AAV-7839-2020; Gravili, Cinzia/ABB-4127-2020; Terlizzi, Antonio/B-6131-2015; Piraino, Stefano/J-5234-2012; BELMONTE, GENUARIO/AAG-4029-2020; BELMONTE, GENUARIO/AAI-9270-2020","Fraschetti, Simonetta/0000-0002-1780-1651; Rubino, Fernando/0000-0003-2552-2510; Fanelli, Giovanni/0000-0002-3594-7603; Gravili, Cinzia/0000-0001-8412-4390; Terlizzi, Antonio/0000-0001-5968-4548; Piraino, Stefano/0000-0002-8752-9390; BELMONTE, GENUARIO/0000-0002-7473-116X; Giangrande, Adriana/0000-0003-4531-2377; Guidetti, Paolo/0000-0002-7983-8775; Boero, Ferdinando/0000-0002-6317-2710",,,,1,24,27,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1476-945X,,,ECOL COMPLEX,Ecol.

Evidence rarely considers the complexities of social-ecological systems. The Social-Ecological Systems Framework (SESF) is an adaptable yet structured approach for understanding the processes that lead to changes in natural resources, using a systems-based approach that aims to treat ecological and social components equally. Few conservation planning and policy initiatives have implemented the SESF to assess the interlinked social and ecological consequences of conservation policies. We apply the SESF to explore the barriers to the potential implementation of a policy of consumptive utilisation of wildlife in Kenya, a policy regarded as successful in several southern African countries. Using secondary data and expert review we developed a conceptual model of the social-ecological system associated with consumptive utilisation of wildlife in Kenya. We then analysed how different combinations of first and second-tier variables interacted to create focal action situations, and subsequently identified seven barriers to this policy. Our analysis revealed that game ranching would require large-scale investment in effective monitoring systems, new regulations, training, market development and research, considerations about equity, and devolved ownership of wildlife. The least barriers existed for game farming. The SESF appears to be a useful framework for this purpose. In particular, it can help to reveal potential social and ecological barriers which conservation policies might face in attempting to meet intended goals. The information required to implement the SESF are necessarily cross-disciplinary, which can make it challenging to synthesise.","[Tyrrell, Peter; Kamanga, John] South Rift Assoc Landowners, POB 15289, Nairobi 00509, Kenya; [Tyrrell, Peter] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Oxford, England; [Brehony, Peadar] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge, England; [Waruingi, Lucy] African Conservat Ctr, POB 15289, Nairobi 00509, Kenya; [Kaelo, Dickson] Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Assoc, POB 1038, Nairobi 00517, Kenya","Tyrrell, P (corresponding author), South Rift Assoc Landowners, POB 15289, Nairobi 00509, Kenya.",peterdavidtyrrell@gmaill.com,,"Brehony, Peadar/0000-0003-1315-7683",,,,76,1,1,5,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,1873-2917,,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

However, for many ecologists, and particularly field ecologists, a comprehensive framework clearly emphasizing how and why the CSA provides a unique corpus for studying ecosystem functions is missing. The purpose of this article is thus to provide an overview of the different themes visited during the evening session and to emphasize the distinctiveness of the CSA as an alternative to contemporary ecological issues.

To accommodate the non-Gaussian covariance of the data, SAGE uses t-stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to reduce dimensionality. Over a hundred eco-provinces are identified with the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. Using a connectivity graph with ecological dissimilarity as the distance metric, robust aggregated eco-provinces (AEPs) are objectively defined by nesting the eco-provinces. Using the AEPs, the control of nutrient supply rates on community structure is explored. Eco-provinces and AEPs are unique and aid model interpretation.

For over a century, scientists have been testing many biological, chemical and physical questions to understand various ecosystems and their resilience to different stressors. While the majority of experiments were conducted at small-scale laboratory settings, lately large mesocosm experiments have become more and more common. Yet, it still remains unclear how the scale (i.e. space) and ecological complexity (i.e. community versus limited number of species) of experiments affect the results and to what extent different experimental types are comparable. Innovation Here, we conducted two types of experiments, run at different scale and ecological-complexity levels (i.e. outdoor large-scale community-level mesocosm versus indoor small-scale two-species laboratory experiment), to assess the effects of marine heatwaves on two gammarid species. Main Conclusions Our approach detected differences in abundance and relative population growth between the two experimental types for one out of the two tested species, but no difference in heatwave impacts on any of the species, independently of which experimental type was used. The larger space in the mesocosm, accompanied with inclusion of the community, benefited this species, demonstrating stronger performance in the mesocosm than in the laboratory experiment. Though, our study design cannot directly distinguish if scale or ecological complexity of the experiments, or both, caused the observed discrepancy in our findings. Furthermore, inconsistency in results among laboratory experiments complicates the extrapolations and generalization of the laboratory results. Yet, our findings indicate the importance of space, density-dependent effects, biotic interactions and complexity of natural environments in buffering, or boosting, the direct effects of environmental stress on organisms. Therefore, we urge the use of large-scale community-level mesocosm experiments instead of small-scale single-species laboratory ones whenever possible, and emphasize a necessity of great caution when interpreting the results of laboratory experiments.","[Paiva, Filipa; Briski, Elizabeta] Helmholtz Zentrum Ozeanforsch Kiel, GEOMAR, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Paiva, Filipa] Agencia Reg Desenvolvimento Invest Tecnol & Inova, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Edificio Madeira Tecnopolo, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal; [Brennecke, Dennis] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Terr & Aquat Wildlife Res, Busum, Germany; [Brennecke, Dennis] Univ Southern Denmark, Marine Biol Res Ctr, Dept Biol, Kerteminde, Denmark; [Brennecke, Dennis] Leibniz Inst Sci & Math Educ, Kiel, Germany; [Pansch, Christian] Abo Akad Univ, Dept Environm & Marine Biol, Turku, Finland","Briski, E (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Ozeanforsch Kiel, GEOMAR, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",ebriski@geomar.de,"Briski, Elizabeta/A-7910-2015; Pansch, Christian/I-9170-2012; Paiva, Filipa/O-8111-2015","Pansch, Christian/0000-0001-8442-4502; Paiva, Filipa/0000-0002-2857-5557",Alexander von Humboldt-StiftungAlexander von Humboldt Foundation,Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung,,54,1,1,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

However, simplistic approaches to controlling such sources of infection by culling wildlife populations may not adequately address ecological complexities. In the UK and Ireland the badger is implicated in the spread of bovine TB to cattle and has been the subject of several culling strategies. Field studies demonstrate that culling leads to substantial social perturbation of badger populations, and can be associated with increases in the incidence of infection in cattle. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the social perturbation associated with badger culling may have epidemiological consequences that hinder the effective control of infection in cattle. The development of sustainable strategies for the effective management of disease in wildlife populations requires careful consideration of the demographic and behavioural responses to intervention.","Cent Sci Lab, Wildlife Dis Ecol Team, York YO41 1LZ, N Yorkshire, England","Delahay, RJ (corresponding author), Cent Sci Lab, Wildlife Dis Ecol Team, York YO41 1LZ, N Yorkshire, England.",,"Delahay, Richard/J-2261-2014",,,,,36,3,3,1,22,BRITISH CATTLE VETERINARY ASSOC,FRAMPTON-ON-SEVERN,"THE GREEN, FRAMPTON-ON-SEVERN GL2 7EP, GLOS, ENGLAND",0969-1251,,,CATTLE PRACT,Cattle Pract.,FEB,2006,14,,1,,,,7,11,,,,5,Veterinary Sciences,Veterinary Sciences,020EH,,,,,9/23/21,,,

Because little is known regarding their conservation status in relation to the diversity of land-use patterns and habitats, this paper explores patterns of species composition and diversity of medicinal plants in five different pasture types in a traditionally-managed high-altitude landscape in northwest Nepal. Environmental variables, including human activities, strongly affected species composition, diversity and cover-abundance of medicinal plant species. Species richness of rare and commercially threatened medicinal plants (CTMP) showed patterns similar to overall medicinal plant species richness. Sub-alpine meadows, which have intermediate levels of human pressure related to grazing and relatively high levels of resource availability in terms of rainfall and soil nutrients, were richer in medicinal-plant species than alpine meadows. The coexistence of various plant communities under different human management regimes also enhanced landscape-level species diversity by maintaining some species restricted to particular habitat or pasture types. A number of medicinal plant species reported to be resistant to grazing were most abundant in heavily grazed sites. This pattern suggests that medicinal plant species may be positively influenced, to a certain extent, by human activities (mainly grazing). The combination of grazing and high levels of harvesting, however, had a negative impact on diversity and cover-abundance of rare and CTMP species. Maintenance of medicinal plant diversity and cover-abundance is critically dependent on managing grazing and resource harvesting to maintain levels that are both ecologically and economically sustainable. Forage for livestock and medicinal plants for local health care cannot be managed independently; a systems approach is needed, incorporating social management to accommodate the needs of different users. This could be achieved by maintenance of a mosaic landscape, in which different use patterns and pressures, reflecting the values attached to resources by different users and favouring different types of biodiversity, co-exist.","CNRS, UMR 5175, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Bot, Kathmandu, Nepal","Aumeeruddy-Thomas, Y (corresponding author), CNRS, UMR 5175, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",thomas@cefe.cnrs.fr,,,,,,54,15,17,1,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0376-8929,1469-4387,,ENVIRON CONSERV,Environ.

Existing landscape models, such as the fragmentation model (or patch-matrix-corridor model) and the variegation model, can be limited in their ability to explain complex patterns for different species and across multiple scales. An alternative approach is to conceptualize landscapes as overlaid species-specific habitat contour maps. Key characteristics of this approach are that different species may respond differently to the same environmental conditions and at different spatial scales. Although similar approaches are being used in ecological modeling, there is much room for habitat contours as a useful conceptual tool. By providing an alternative view of landscapes, a contour model may stimulate more field investigations stratified on the basis of ecological variables other than human-defined patches and patch boundaries. A conceptual model of habitat contours may also help to communicate ecological complexity to land managers. Finally, by incorporating additional ecological complexity, a conceptual model based on habitat contours may help to bridge the perceived gap between pattern and process in landscape ecology. Habitat contours do not preclude the use of existing landscape models and should be seen as a complementary approach most suited to heterogeneous human-modified landscapes.","Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Resource & Environm Studies, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Fischer, J (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Resource & Environm Studies, Bldg 43, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",joern@cres.anu.edu.au,"Fischer, Joern/C-6625-2012; Lindenmayer, David B/P-7183-2017","Fischer, Joern/0000-0003-3187-8978; Lindenmayer, David B/0000-0002-4766-4088",,,,70,69,73,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Ants also occur naturally in coffee landscapes, opening the door to conservation biocontrol approaches, which can promote both biodiversity conservation and crop production. Here, we review evidence that shows that ants antagonize and predate CBB, reduce CBB infestation, and contribute to the suppression of CBB populations. We discuss the potential mechanisms and impacts of ant diversity and interaction complexity on the functioning of CBB biocontrol. We also discuss the implications of conservation biocontrol in coffee farm management, reviewing literature showing that ant communities and CBB respond to coffee farm intensification and the composition of the agricultural matrix. We assess the potential impacts of ant-CBB biocontrol on coffee production and yield, considering the complexities that result from promoting diverse ant communities in conservation biocontrol, and discuss potential disservices of ants. Finally, we end with several research avenues that are needed to further illuminate the overall role of ant communities on coffee pests and yield and to make specific recommendations for ant-CBB biocontrol management.","[Morris, Jonathan R.; Perfecto, Ivette] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Jimenez-Soto, Esteli; Philpott, Stacy M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Morris, JR (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jonno@umich.edu,,,,,,142,26,26,0,39,"OESTERREICHISCHE GESELL ENTOMOFAUNISTIK, C/O NATURHISTOR MUSEUM WIEN",WIEN,"ZWEITE ZOOLOGISCHE ABTEILUNG (INSEKTEN), BURGRING 7, WIEN, AUSTRIA",1994-4136,,,MYRMECOL NEWS,Myrmecol.

Drawing on evidence from United Nations climate change and biodiversity conferences between 2009 and 2018, I show how methods such as discourse analysis and process tracing can help to apply a deliberative ecologies perspective and thereby advance understanding of how discourses and deliberative practices diffuse through negotiating sites and how deliberation interacts with the social-ecological dynamics of those sites.","[Pickering, Jonathan] Univ Canberra, Ctr Deliberat Democracy & Global Governance, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Pickering, Jonathan] Australian Res Council, Funded Project, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Pickering, J (corresponding author), Univ Canberra, Ctr Deliberat Democracy & Global Governance, Canberra, ACT, Australia.; Pickering, J (corresponding author), Australian Res Council, Funded Project, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,"Pickering, Jonathan/Q-5744-2018","Pickering, Jonathan/0000-0002-1862-3623",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [FL140100154],"Earlier versions of this paper were presented at a workshop on Call for Methodological Diversity: Understanding the Inside of Environmental Agreement Making at the University of California Berkeley and the Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis, University of Canberra.

Understanding the dynamic nature of human-environment interactions is critical for mitigating the impacts of human induced environmental change and understanding how the environment shapes social systems. Current research has focused on the reduced ability of many natural systems to provide ecosystem services and the subsequent impact on human well-being. Furthermore, there has been a proliferation of cases analyzing the impacts of payment programs designed to enhance ecosystem services. However, analyses that link environmental policies through to their ecological results are not common and methods to do so are not thoroughly developed. To better analyze these interactions, a theory or framework is necessary. This article presents a framework of social ecological complex adaptive systems (SECAS). The framework links structuration theory from social science with the theories of complex adaptive systems from ecology to provide an enhanced understanding of the human drivers and responses to environmental change. The framework is presented as a recursive process where social and ecological systems are both the medium for and product of social action and ecological disturbance.

Since biological interactions themselves can create heterogeneity in space, the heterogeneity necessary for the persistence of an unstable system could be the result of local interactions involving elements of the unstable system itself. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we report on a predatory ladybird beetle whose natural history suggests that the beetle requires the patchy distribution of the mutualism between its prey, the green coffee scale, and the arboreal ant, Azteca instabilis. Based on known ecological interactions and the natural history of the system, we constructed a spatially-explicit model and showed that the clustered spatial pattern of ant nests facilitates the persistence of the beetle populations. Furthermore, we show that the dynamics of the beetle consuming the scale insects can cause the clustered distribution of the mutualistic ants in the first place. Conclusions/Significance: From a theoretical point of view, our model represents a novel situation in which a predator indirectly causes a spatial pattern of an organism other than its prey, and in doing so facilitates its own persistence. From a practical point of view, it is noteworthy that one of the elements in the system is a persistent pest of coffee, an important world commodity. This pest, we argue, is kept within limits of control through a complex web of ecological interactions that involves the emergent spatial pattern.","[Liere, Heidi] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Jackson, Doug; Vandermeer, John] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Liere, H (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",liere@wisc.edu,,,"U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0349388]; Graham Environmental Sustainability Institute fellowship, University of Michigan; Helen Olsen Brower Fellowship, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Michigan","U.S. National Science Foundation, DEB 0349388 to JV and Ivette Perfecto; Graham Environmental Sustainability Institute fellowship, University of Michigan, to HL and DJ; and Helen Olsen Brower Fellowship, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Michigan, to HL.

These systems currently require standard or customized surface fire behavior fuel models as inputs that are often assigned through remote sensing information. The ability to handle hundreds or thousands of measured surface fuelbeds representing the fine scale variation in fire behavior on the landscape is constrained in terms of creating compatible custom fire behavior fuel models. In this study, we demonstrate an objective method for taking ecologically complex fuelbeds from inventory observations and converting those into a set of custom fuel models that can be mapped to the original landscape. We use an original set of 629 fuel inventory plots measured on an 80,000 ha contiguous landscape in the upper Atlantic Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States. From models linking stand conditions to component fuel loads, we impute fuelbeds for over 6000 stands. These imputed fuelbeds were then converted to fire behavior parameters under extreme fuel moisture and wind conditions (97th percentile) using the fuel characteristic classification system (FCCS) to estimate surface fire rate of spread, surface fire flame length, shrub layer reaction intensity (heat load), non-woody layer reaction intensity, woody layer reaction intensity, and litter-lichen-moss layer reaction intensity. We performed hierarchical cluster analysis of the stands based on the values of the fire behavior parameters. The resulting 7 clusters were the basis for the development of 7 custom fire behavior fuel models from the cluster centroids that were calibrated against the FCCS point data for wind and fuel moisture. The latter process resulted in calibration against flame length as it was difficult to obtain a simultaneous calibration against both rate of spread and flame length. The clusters based on FCCS fire behavior parameters represent reasonably identifiable stand conditions, being: (1) pine dominated stands with more litter and down woody debris components than other stands, (2) hardwood and pine stands with no shrubs, (3) hardwood dominated stands with low shrub and high non-woody biomass and high down woody debris, (4) stands with high grass and forb (i.e., non-woody) biomass as well as substantial shrub biomass, (5) stands with both high shrub and litter biomass, (6) pine-mixed hardwood stands with moderate litter biomass and low shrub biomass, and (7) baldcypress-tupelo stands. Models representing these stand clusters generated flame lengths from 0.6 to 2.3 m using a 30 km h(-1) wind speed and fireline intensities of 100-1500 kW m(-1) that are typical within the range of experience on this landscape. The fuel models ranked 1 < 2 < 7 < 5 < 4 < 3 < 6 in terms of both flame length and fireline intensity. The method allows for ecologically complex data to be utilized in order to create a landscape representative of measured fuel conditions and to create models that interface with geospatial fire models.

The nature of ecological risk assessment is to predict the probability of an event, such as extinction or invasion, in a location where the event has rarely occurred. This typically requires developing risk models from data on events in different locations. One perplexing challenge in developing these models is to find the optimal balance of model complexity that reflects the tactical details of a system, but is sufficiently strategic to be applicable under a wide range of situations. 2. Here we address the balance of complexity in risk models for the mountain pine beetle system. Mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) are destructive pests of pine forests in western North America. Much effort has gone into collecting empirical evidence and developing mechanistic models of infestation dynamics, which has resulted in a wealth of process-based information. Current risk models, however, are based solely on indices of stand susceptibility that do not incorporate much of this ecological understanding. In practice, current risk models have proven ineffective at predicting the risk or extent of an infestation. 3. We assemble an ecological framework of the beetle-host interaction that allows us to compare across phenomenological and mechanistic models. We demonstrate that current risk models predict only ranked risk among forest stands, as opposed to absolute risk, and thereby provide an explanation for their limited ability to predict risk in practice. By comparing existing models with the ecological framework, we identify the primary factors determining risk, and propose which dynamical processes should be modelled explicitly, and which might be strategically abstracted. 4. Synthesis and applications. Balancing model complexity in predictive risk models is challenging for systems with complex ecology and imperfect information. Here we draw together a wide range of empirical and modelling work in the mountain pine beetle system to develop a strategic framework of the ecological interactions. Through this framework, we demonstrate why current risk models have been ineffective in predicting risk, and suggest a starting point for future risk models that explicitly describe the dynamical processes necessary to predict absolute risk.","[Nelson, William A.; Potapov, Alex; Lewis, Mark A.] Univ Alberta, Ctr Math Biol, Edmonton, AB T6G 1G1, Canada; [Hundsdrfer, Anina E.; He, Fangliang] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada","Nelson, WA (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3NS, Canada.",nelsonw@queensu.ca,"Nelson, William A/D-1405-2013; Lewis, Mark/A-2659-2014; Lewis, Mark A/C-5015-2008","Lewis, Mark A/0000-0002-7155-7426",,,,51,17,18,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Exergy and specific exergy estimate structural complexity while throughput and information functional complexity. OCI was applied to benthic habitats in a coastal marine tract encompassing a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in north-western Italy. The four individual indices did not always show homogeneous results in assigning complexity to different habitats. On the contrary, the additive measure provided by OCI showed that seagrass meadows and coralligenous reefs are in all the most complex habitats. Applying OCI provided results consistent with traditional approaches based on expert judgement, which usually attach more interest to seagrass meadows and hard bottoms with respect to soft bottoms, but expressed a synthetic, objective and quantitative approach. OCI can be mapped for management purposes, resolving the discordances evidenced by the individual indices. Ecological complexity in the study area is concentrated in some hot spots, as mapped by OCI, while the greatest part of the seafloor is occupied by low complexity habitats. Only some of these complexity hotspots are included within the Marine Protected Area, while this study suggests that high complexity areas, adjacent to the existing MPA, should be considered for protection possibly reshaping MPA's limits.

The complete Holocene sedimentary facies that were exclusively formed in the valley and evidenced by bio-geochemical measurement, showed the Latest Pleistocene fluvial facies to the Early-Holocene marine facies, and the Middle-Late Holocene deltaic facies. The established Holocene stratigraphic framework consists of 3 (I-III) infilling phases, of which phase I demonstrated the most rapidly infilling with coastal sediments into the valley (1.0 cm/yr), driven by the Early Holocene marine transgression. The remarkably low sedimentation rate of 0.1 cm/yr of phase II to the relatively low rate of 0.7 cm/yr of phase III occurred during the Middle-Late Holocene, reflecting sediments transported from river basin to directly fill in the valley along with deltaic depocenter shifted seawards as retrogressive processes. In addition, our microfossil (foraminifera and diatom) spectra displayed 3 distinctive biological stages with related sedimentary-ecological implications. During the Early Holocene, there were remarkably high numbers of diatom communities but few foraminifera, then followed a zone of less abundant microfossils between ca. 9.0-5.0 ka. After this time, richer foraminiferal communities appeared but diatoms were less abundant. The massive sediment infilling in the Early Holocene in the deeper (>60 m) incised valley would suppress benthic foraminiferal development, most likely due to anaerobic conditions in the lower water column. However, the flourishing diatom communities persisted in the brackish marine water associated with sea-level rise. The zone with fewer microfossils corresponded generally with the Middle Holocene sandy ridge formation at the core site, leading to poorer bio-preservation. After ca. 5.0 ka, foraminiferal communities gradually became adapted to the reduced salinity of the estuarine water associated with the deltaic progradation, though this appears not to have supported the diatom communities.","[Jiang, Feng; Wang, Yanna; Zhao, Xiaoshuang; Liu, Yan; Chen, Jing; Sun, Qianli; Li, Maotian; Chen, Zhongyuan] East China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Feng] Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Marine Geol, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Finlayson, Brian] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","Wang, YN (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",ynwang@sklec.ecnu.edu.cn; xszhao@sklec.ecnu.edu.cn; liuyan@sklec.ecnu.edu.cn; jchen@geo.ecnu.edu.cn; qlsun@sklec.ecnu.edu.cn; mtli@sklec.ecnu.edu.cn; brianlf@unimelb.edu.au; z.chen@sklec.ecnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41620104004, 41771226, 2016YFE0133700]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","We are grateful to Prof. W.G.

The agent of an infectious animal or zoonotic disease depends for its multiplication and dispersion on a wild host species to which it has adapted over time and which constitutes the reservoir of the corresponding infectious disease. If the biotope of this initial host is sustainably modified, the associated biocenosis migrates with its pathogenic flora to a new habitat, enabling the pathogen to change animal host species. If this migration introduces it into the human environment, the infectious agent may pass to humans or to a commensal wildlife or domestic species that will serve as an intermediate host. This ecological mechanism involves multiple and complex interactions that result in a direct link between biodiversity erosion and increased frequency of these emergences in humans. Together with at-risk human socio-economic practices, it determines the distribution of the territories where these diseases emerge worldwide. Chronic diseases and psychosocial vulnerabilities in humans could potentially worsen the phenomenon. To be able to carry out a targeted action to identify and stop an outbreak of an unknown infectious disease, we need to be able to predict which pathogen is most likely to constitute a threat and in which regions of the world. It is a difficult scientific problem that requires a holistic vision of the one health type that decompartmentalizes animal health, human health, and ecosystem health, and a transdisciplinary approach focusing on the microbial ecology of infectious diseases, the biology of evolution, and the social sciences.","[Lesne, Jean] Univ Paris, EHESP, Batiment Buffon Case Courrier 7073, F-75205 Paris 13, France; [Lesne, Jean] Univ Paris, Soc Francophone Sante Environm SFSE, Batiment Buffon Case Courrier 7073, F-75205 Paris 13, France","Lesne, J (corresponding author), Univ Paris, EHESP, Batiment Buffon Case Courrier 7073, F-75205 Paris 13, France.; Lesne, J (corresponding author), Univ Paris, Soc Francophone Sante Environm SFSE, Batiment Buffon Case Courrier 7073, F-75205 Paris 13, France.",jean.lesne@laposte.net,,,,,,20,0,0,3,3,JOHN LIBBEY EUROTEXT LTD,ARCUEIL,"30, RUE BERTHOLLET, BATIMENT A, 94110 ARCUEIL, FRANCE",1635-0421,1952-3998,,ENVIRON RISQUE SANTE,Environ.

These ENs can maintain indigenous and historic compositional and functional biodiversity, even in an area prone to the challenging effects of El Nio. Furthermore, ENs increase the effective size of local protected areas. Socio-ecological solutions and financial viability are also integrated as part of practical implementation of ENs.

Location Gippsland, south-eastern Australia. Methods In 50 2-ha stands ranging in age from < 5 years to mature stands > 100 years, we undertook repeated avian surveys, performed detailed habitat measurements and estimated amounts of above-ground carbon. Extensive wildfire reduced the number of sites to 28 (seven in each of four age classes) upon which analyses and inferences were made. We also analysed data on carbon storage and some bird responses from previously published studies. Results Mature vegetation (> 100 years) had the greatest richness, abundance and biomass of birds. Key ecological resources, such as tree-hollows for nesting, generally occurred mostly in stands > 60 years. Avian richness per unit of above-ground carbon storage was relatively low for stands of 20-60 years. While above-ground carbon storage appeared to increase in a monotonic fashion as stands age and mature, there were quantum increases in all measures of avian biodiversity in mature stands (> 100 years). Main conclusions Our results suggest that carbon is organized in a different way, with substantially greater biodiversity benefits, in very old stands. Mature vegetation simultaneously maximizes both avian biodiversity and above-ground carbon storage. These results bolster arguments for allocating highest priorities to the preservation of old-growth forest stands rather than alternative investments (e.g. reafforestation for carbon sequestration).","[Hatanaka, Narelle; Wright, Wendy] Monash Univ, Sch Appl Sci & Engn, Churchill, Vic 3842, Australia; [Loyn, Richard H.] Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Sustainabil & Environm, Heidelberg, Vic, Australia","Mac Nally, R (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Ctr Biodivers, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",Ralph.MacNally@sci.monash.edu.au,"Wright, Wendy/AAM-8059-2021","Wright, Wendy/0000-0003-3388-1273; Loyn, Richard/0000-0002-7337-0518","Institute of Regional Studies, Monash UniversityMonash University; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP0560518, DP0984170, DP0343898, LP0990038]","This research was supported by scholarships from the Institute of Regional Studies, Monash University and Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment.

However, on-ground management decisions are often made under time, knowledge and capacity constraints. Spatially explicit tools for assessing invasion risk rapidly and under uncertainty would help land managers to better target interventions. We developed a generic methodology that integrates (a) interactions between ecological risk factors and invasion processes affecting both the potential suitability for population growth and the actual susceptibility to propagule introduction from source populations with (b) spatially explicit data in (c) a probabilistic Bayesian network modelling framework. Our methods focused on the operational needs of land mangers responding to weed incursions, streamlining data and knowledge collection, simplifying model calibration, and facilitating adoption via a collection of user-friendly web apps called riskmapr. We tested the generality of our methodology on two contrasting weeds (the rainforest tree Cecropia spp. and the cactus Cylindropuntia rosea) that are targeted for containment and local eradication in Queensland, Australia. Case study models were calibrated from published knowledge about abiotic and biotic factors affecting suitability for, and susceptibility to, weed invasion. Validation of annual risk maps against weed detections in subsequent years showed that models accurately predicted the field-observed progression of each invasion to date. We developed a rapid spatial risk modelling methodology that is theoretically comprehensive and practically simple. Our streamlined methods and open access implementation using riskmapr facilitate adoption by land managers. Models and risk maps can be used to target interventions or improve spatially explicit understanding of the risk factors and processes driving early weed invasions.","[Froese, Jens G.; Pearse, Alan R.; Hamilton, Grant] QUT, Sch Earth Environm & Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Pearse, Alan R.] QUT, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Math & Stat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Froese, Jens G.] CSIRO Hlth & Biosecur, Dutton Pk, Qld 4102, Australia","Froese, JG (corresponding author), QUT, Sch Earth Environm & Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",jens.froese@csiro.au,"; Froese, Jens/P-3215-2015","Pearse, Alan/0000-0002-4133-8548; Froese, Jens/0000-0001-5920-6431; Hamilton, Grant/0000-0001-8445-0575",Plant Biosecurity Cooperative Research Centre,Plant Biosecurity Cooperative Research Centre,,47,2,2,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

Eight hypothetical types of wetlands, predicted as differing in their plant communities, were proposed by combination of three factors (geomorphological pattern, river incision vs aggradation, groundwater origin), selected because they determine the effects of flood disturbances (intensity, frequency) and the water supplies. This hypothesis was tested through the comparison of the vegetation and the physico-chemistry of cut-off channels of the Ain River in France. Cutoff meanders were related to meso-eutraphent plant species of standing water, aggraded meanders being more frequently overflowed than incised ones. Braided channels were characterized by flood-tolerant species, some of the incised ones being related to oligotraphent communities, but some remaining connected, through seepage and floods, to the river (mesotraphent species). The ratio of side-hill aquifer to seepage supplying these channels depends on river vs aquifer levels but also on their elevation from the river level, determined by their age. The study demonstrates the effect of geomorphology and of water supplies on floristic assemblages, but some other features must also be considered. The high diversity of functioning implies that conservation of such ecosystems should consider all the parts of the river landscape and all the processes that interfere on several time-scales.

Recent studies however found extensive loss of tropical. forest habitat around protected areas, vastly contributing to increase the levels of ecotogical. isotation. Using high-resolution satellite data we investigated the isolation trend occurring in the W-Arty-Pendjari (WAP) ecological complex in West Africa. A land-cover change analysis was performed for the period 1984-2002: savanna vegetation extension and toss were derived within the complex and in a 30 km peripheral buffer. Sample regions in the buffer were also analysed using selected spatial. indicators to quantify temporal trends in habitat fragmentation. Implications for change in relative capacity to conserve biodiversity were discussed through the calculation of the species richness capacity (SRC). More than 14.5% of savanna habitat was lost in the WAP peripheral areas, while 0.3% was converted inside the complex. The degree of fragmentation of remnant savanna habitat has also drastically increased. Despite the effectiveness of the park conservation programme, we found through the SRC approach that the WAP complex is decreasing its potential capacity to conserve species richness. This process is mainly due to the rapid and extended agricultural expansion taking place around the complex. A better understanding of the ecological dynamics occurring in the peripheral regions of reserves and the consideration of development needs are key variables to achieve conservation goals in protected areas.

New science reveals that these multiple stressors interact and may affect a multitude of physiological and ecological processes in complex ways. The interaction of multiple stressors and ecological complexity may mean that the negative effects on coral reef ecosystems will happen sooner and be more severe than previously thought. Yet, most research on the effects of global change on coral reefs focus on one or few stressors, pathways or outcomes (e.g., bleaching). Based on a critical review of the literature, we call for a regionally targeted strategy of mesocosm-level research that addresses this complexity and provides more realistic projections about coral reef impacts in the face of global environmental change.

In this paper we explore how learning for sustainability is shaped by meaning, interpretation and experience, in the context of UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BRs). The World Network of Biosphere Reserves brings environmental conservation, socio-economic development and research together in 'learning sites for sustainable development.' The World Network is globally significant, with 669 BRs in 120 countries, but as with many paradigmatic sustainability interventions BRs are perceived to suffer from a 'concept-reality gap.' We explore this gap from an interpretive perspective, focusing on participant interpretations of the meaning of BRs and their experiences of working with the concept - with the aim of painting a richer picture of learning for sustainability and the ways in which BRs might fulfil their role as learning sites. We provide a cross-case analysis of learning in 11 BRs around the world, drawing on interviews with 177 participants, and ask: How is the BR concept interpreted and enacted by people involved with BR work? What learning emerges through BR work, as described by those involved? We find that the BR concept is interpreted differently in each location, producing distinct expectations, practices and institutional designs. Learning occurs around common themes - human environment relationships, actors and governance arrangements, and skills to navigate BR work - but is expressed very differently in each BR. The position of BRs 'in between' social, ecological and economic goals; local places and global networks; and government, private and civil society sectors, provides a valuable space for participants to learn to live with social-ecological complexity. We discuss our results in terms of their contribution to three pressing concerns in sustainability science: (i) power and politics in learning for sustainability, (ii) intermediaries and bridging organizations in multi-level governance, and (iii) reflexivity and knowledge action relationships. Our comparative hermeneutic approach makes a novel methodological contribution to interpretive studies of sustainability policy and governance.","[Schultz, Lisen; West, Simon; Bourke, Alba Juarez; d'Armengol, Laia; Torrents, Pau; Hardardottir, Hildur] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Bourke, Alba Juarez] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [d'Armengol, Laia] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Jansson, Annie] Stockholm Univ, Dept Human Geog, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Roldan, Alba Mohedano] Stockholm Univ, Dept Polit Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","West, S (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",simon.west@su.se,"d'Armengol, Laia/AAA-5681-2020","West, Simon/0000-0002-9738-0593; Schultz, Lisen/0000-0003-4763-8872; d'Armengol, Laia/0000-0001-8922-2053",VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council [2011-1837]; Ebba och Sven Schwartz Stiftelse; Mistra,"We thank all participants in our study for sharing their experiences with us.

Bacterial ooze is often produced on the surface of infected plants and bacterial galls are produced in place of seed. R. toxicus is a regulated plant pathogen in the U.S. yet reliable detection and diagnostic tools are lacking. To better understand this geographically-isolated plant pathogen, genetic variation as a function of geographic location, host species, and date of isolation was determined for isolates collected over a forty-year period. Discriminant analyses of recently collected and archived isolates using Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) and Inter-Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) identified three populations of R. toxicus; RT-I and RT-II from South Australia and RT-III from Western Australia. Population RT-I, detected in 2013 and 2014 from the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia, is a newly emerged population of R. toxicus not previously reported. Commonly used housekeeping genes failed to discriminate among the R. toxicus isolates. However, strategically selected and genome-dispersed MLST genes representing an array of cellular functions from chromosome replication, antibiotic resistance and biosynthetic pathways to bacterial acquired immunity were discriminative. Genetic variation among isolates within the RT-I population was less than the within-population variation for the previously reported RT-II and RT-III populations. The lower relative genetic variation within the RT-I population and its absence from sampling over the past 40 years suggest its recent emergence. RT-I was the dominant population on the Yorke Peninsula during the 2013-2014 sampling period perhaps indicating a competitive advantage over the previously detected RT-II population. The potential for introduction of this bacterial plant pathogen into new geographic areas provide a rationale for understanding the ecological and evolutionary trajectories of R. toxicus.","[Arif, Mohammad; Busot, Grethel Y.; Liu, Sanzhen; Stack, James P.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Throckmorton Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Mann, Rachel; Rodoni, Brendan] Dept Econ Dev Jobs Transport & Resources, Biosci Res Div, Bundoora, Vic, Australia; [Arif, Mohammad; Busot, Grethel Y.; Mann, Rachel; Rodoni, Brendan; Stack, James P.] Plant Biosecur Cooperat Res Ctr, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Stack, JP (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Throckmorton Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.; Stack, JP (corresponding author), Plant Biosecur Cooperat Res Ctr, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",jstack@ksu.edu,"Arif, Mohammad/M-5755-2013",,"Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centres Program, Canberra, AustraliaAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme; Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station [16-130-J, 27765]","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centres Program, Canberra, Australia.

The benefits humans and society can derive from biophysical processes cannot be viewed as objectively existing out there, but as entangled in social and political processes. This is unpacked through the analytical moments of generation, distribution and articulation of ecosystem services. Social practice moderates the generation of benefits from biophysical processes (through urban development patterns and day-to-day management of urban ecosystems), but also who in society that benefits from them, i.e. the distribution of ecosystem services (viewed here as the temporal and spatial scales at which it is possible for humans to benefit from biophysical processes). Moreover, for biophysical processes to attain value in decision-making, a social practice of value articulation is needed. The framework then moves between two levels of analysis. At the city-wide level, an ecological network translates how urban 'green' areas, viewed as nodes, are interconnected by ecological flows (water, species movement, etc.) where nodes have different protective and management capacities. The network captures spatial complexity-what happens in one location, can have effects elsewhere. At the local level, urban struggles over land-use are studied to trace how actors utilize artifacts and social arenas to articulate how certain biophysical processes are of value. Competing networks of value articulation strive to influence land-use, and multiple local studies bring understanding of how power operates locally, informing city-wide analyses. Empirical studies from Stockholm, Cape Town and other cities inform the framework. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

General assumptions about classroom learning tend towards a one-way information flow from a teacher to a relatively passive learner within a linear path (from theory to application) and an homogeneous knowledge base. Research has shown a different, non linear landscape, where learners are diverse (both in knowledge and learning ways), theory and application have mutual influence and intercommunication (multiple and dense information flow) is the basis for knowledge intensification. Knowledge is continuously created, so recognizing, capturing and questioning it is vital. The course uses a social network (first opened on http://ar-ca3.ning.com/ - moved to http://grou.ps/arca3/ - public and seamlessly connected to other web ecologies) as a meme pool: the flow of memes (basic units of information) forms networks of raising emergent complexity up to evolved systems of thinking in this platform for knowledge exchange, an information ecosystem that is an aspect of our natural ecosystem. Students and teachers share experiences and are exposed to different stimulations, engaging reflection in front of the unexpected and the heterogeneous. Workshops (used to teach tools) are a necessary completion of a theoretical framework; the intensive knowledge application to a specific issue through a learning by doing experience pushes cognition acceleration. Theory + design strategies The core of the approach is a theoretical framework which gravitates around the key concepts of . nature as a CAS . emergence . complexity + network model . information, morphogenesis and evolution . environmental sensibility and design ecologies Design strategies follow a 3 stages open path: rule-based morphogenesis, trials and errors, evaluation and selection. Errors are the real chances of learning in front of the unexpected: the new information gained can then feedback in the design process or make it diverge towards new paths. Environmental sensibility is embedded since morphogenesis through information-driven processes and perpetually monitored. Tools Knowledge is a continuous process of modeling, tools and brains are mutually shaping each other. The course structure exploits a set of tools ranging from teaching to design tools (taught through workshops), the most important being: Teaching tools: . the social network and its connected web ecologies . VUE (visual understanding environment): non-linear organization of lectures, focusing on connections more than on notions; . lectures by leading-edge figures of architectural scenario (t<>p lecture series - http://grou.ps/arca3/calendar/event/130300) Design tools: . Rhinoceros . Rhinoscript, Grasshopper . Autodesk(R) Maya . Ecotect Tools were taught leading to the fabrication of a simple design idea from the digital model.

A key question in primate communication is the association between the social relationships of primates and their repertoire of gestures. Such analyses can reveal how primates use their repertoire of gestural communication to maintain their networks of family and friends, much as humans use language to maintain their social networks. In this study we examined the association between the repertoire of gestures (overall, manual and bodily gestures, and gestures of different modalities) and social bonds (presence of reciprocated grooming), coordinated behaviors (travel, resting, co-feeding), and the complexity of ecology (e.g. noise, illumination) and sociality (party size, audience), in wild East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). A larger repertoire size of manual, visual gestures was associated with the presence of a relationship based on reciprocated grooming and increases in social complexity. A smaller repertoire of manual tactile gestures occurred when the relationship was based on reciprocated grooming. A smaller repertoire of bodily gestures occurred between partners who jointly traveled for longer. Whereas gesture repertoire size was associated with social complexity, complex ecology also influenced repertoire size. The evolution of a large repertoire of manual, visual gestures may have been a key factor that enabled larger social groups to emerge during evolution. Thus, the evolution of the larger brains in hominins may have co-occurred with an increase in the cognitive complexity underpinning gestural communication and this, in turn, may have enabled hominins to live in more complex social groups.","[Roberts, Sam G.

Stream mesocosms were used to expose naturally colonized benthic communities to a gradient of ferric Fe (0-15 mg/L) for 14 days to estimate the effects of Fe precipitates on primary production, larval and emerging adult aquatic insects, and the macroinvertebrate community structure. Community composition was significantly altered at concentrations near or below the US Environmental Protection Agency chronic Fe criterion (1.0 mg/L). Iron exposure significantly decreased larval and emerging adult abundances of Baetidae (mayfly) and Chironomidae (Diptera); however, while Simuliidae (Diptera) larvae were not reduced by the Fe treatments, abundance of emerged adults significantly decreased. Iron substantially decreased the colonization biomass of green algae and diatoms, with estimated EC20 values well below the Fe criterion. In contrast, cyanobacteria were stimulated with increasing Fe concentration. By integrating environmentally realistic exposure conditions to native benthic communities that have complex structural and functional responses, the ability to predict the effects of Fe in the field is improved. Traditional toxicity testing methodologies were not developed to evaluate indirect effects of contaminants, and modernized approaches such as community mesocosm experiments better characterize and predict responses in aquatic ecosystems outside the laboratory. Therefore, the development of water quality standards would benefit by including mesocosm testing results.","[Kotalik, Christopher J.; Cadmus, Pete; Clements, William H.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA; [Cadmus, Pete] Colorado Pk & Wildlife, Aquat Res, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA","Kotalik, CJ (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA.",Christopher.Kotalik@colostate.edu,"Clements, William/N-2686-2016; Cadmus, Pete/H-1362-2013","Cadmus, Pete/0000-0002-4078-8328",National Institute of Environmental Health ServicesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [1R01ES020917-01],"Funding for this research was provided by National Institute of Environmental Health Services (1R01ES020917-01).

Understanding and projecting responses of Southern Ocean marine ecosystems to changing climate conditions and direct human impacts, such as fisheries, requires integrated ecosystem analyses at scales previously unexplored. Here we consider the main ecological and modelling challenges in predicting the responses of Southern Ocean ecosystems to change, and propose three inter-linked focus areas that will advance the development of integrated models for Southern Ocean ecosystems. The first focus area is development of fundamental understanding of the factors that determine the structure and function of the food webs at multiple scales. Ecological research in the Southern Ocean is often centred on key species or localised systems, a tendency which is reflected in existing food web and ecosystem models. To build on this, a systematic analysis of regional food web structure and function is required. The second focus area is development of a range of mechanistic models that vary in their resolution of ecological processes, and consider links across physical scales, biogeochemical cycles and feedbacks, and the central role of zooplankton. These two focus areas underlie the third, which is development of methodologies for scenario testing across a range of trophic levels of the effects of past and future changes, which will facilitate consideration of the underlying complexity of interactions and the associated uncertainty. The complex nature of interactions determining Southern Ocean ecosystem structure and function will require new approaches, which we propose should be developed within a scale-based framework that emphasises both physical and ecological aspects.

For most marine species, connectivity is synonomous of larval dispersal. We applied a spatially explicit meta-population model to test the hypothesis that larval dispersal can affect local demographical features, consequently misleading conservation practice in the marine environment. Simulations were carried out in the Gulf of Lions where coastal circulation displays highly variable temporal and spatial submeso-scale structures. Two different benthic invertebrate species were considered: a soft bottom short lived species and a hard bottom long lived one. In the first case, simulations showed that highest densities at equilibrium do not inform on self-persistent populations location. In the second case, simulations showed that connectivity effects may result in out-of-equilibria demographical structure. We emphasized the caveats in the parameterization of demographical models when local demography is controlled by connectivity.","[Guizien, Katell; Bramanti, Lorenzo] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Lab Ecogeochim Environm Benth, UMR8222, F-66651 Banyuls Sur Mer, France","Guizien, K (corresponding author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Lab Ecogeochim Environm Benth, UMR8222, Ave Fontaule, F-66651 Banyuls Sur Mer, France.",guizien@obs-banyuls.fr,"Guizien, Katell/I-7061-2016; Guizien, Katell/D-1534-2013; Bramanti, Lorenzo/AAH-5094-2021; Bramanti, Lorenzo/M-5492-2013","Guizien, Katell/0000-0001-9884-7506; Guizien, Katell/0000-0001-9884-7506; Bramanti, Lorenzo/0000-0002-4872-840X; Bramanti, Lorenzo/0000-0002-4872-840X",French National Program LITEAU IV of the Ministere de l'Ecologie et de l'Environnement Durable under project RocConnect [12-MUTS-LITEAU-1-CDS-013]; Connectivite des habitats rocheux fragmentes du Golfe du Lion (de Marseille au Cap de Creus) et son role dans la persistence regionale de trois especes de gorgonaires,"This work was funded by the French National Program LITEAU IV of the Ministere de l'Ecologie et de l'Environnement Durable under project RocConnect - Connectivite des habitats rocheux fragmentes du Golfe du Lion (de Marseille au Cap de Creus) et son role dans la persistence regionale de trois especes de gorgonaires (PI, K.

The dynamical behavior of the system is extensively discussed. Continuous type gestational delay of predators is incorporated in the system to study delay induced instability. It is observed that the system undergoes singularity induced bifurcation at interior equilibrium point when net economic revenue of the system increases through zero. State feedback controller is designed to stabilize the system at positive economic profit. Time delay is considered as a bifurcation parameter to prove the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation phenomenon in the neighborhood of the coexisting equilibrium point. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried out to verify the analytical results and the system is analyzed through graphical illustrations.

The complex ecology of the 1500 km stretch of the Thai-Laos Mekong River has been studied in this paper to understand the relationship with the geomorphology, with the sub-tropical monsoonal climate and the impact of human activity. Sub-surface geology controls the nature and extent of the drainage basin and of the river channel. The volume flow of the river varies naturally and dynamically in phase with the rainfall; traditional models based on steady state hydraulics are inappropriate. Continuous erosion of the river banks and bed generates a sediment load of impure silt, mica, quartz and clay minerals that inhibits light penetration and limits the primary productivity of the river. The river separates two countries at different stages of development; it flows through or close to eight non-industrial conurbations (Populations 350,000-2,000,000) but is otherwise sparsely populated. The river is used for subsistence agriculture, village transport, fishing including aquaculture and as a source of domestic water. Hydroelectricity is generated from the Laos tributaries. The river is a depository for partially treated urban waste and untreated village waste, hence populations of E.coli bacteria sometimes render the water unsuitable for drinking unless treated with the highest value of 240/100ml found at station 7 during the summer season of 2003. Furthermore the river is polluted by trace metals, notably cadmium and mercury, and by Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are particularly concentrated in the sediments. Previous work has shown that cadmium and mercury exceed the Probable Effect Level (PEL) values of Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines and that the PAH concentrations were also greater than the Interim Sediment Quality Guidelines (ISQG). Consequently the fish stock, a vital source of protein for the local human population maybe seriously affected. As conflict between the demands of human activities will be exacerbated by the continuing development of the basin; monitoring must be continued and a better model of the river's ecology is needed to predict the impact of development.","[Sakultantimetha, Arthit; Bangkedphol, Sornnarin; Torrance, Keith; Gibson, Mark D.; Gaines, Alec F.; Booth, Peter H.; Keenan, Helen E.] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Civil Engn, DLCS, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Udomchoke, Veerasak; Sunthornranun, Patcharee; Songsasen, Apisit; Phanwichien, Kantimanee; Jiwapornkupt, Pongsakorn; Homchan, Unop; Lauhachinda, Nitaya] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Sci, Bangkok, Thailand","Keenan, HE (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Dept Civil Engn, DLCS, Graham Hills Bldg, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",h.e.keenan@strath.ac.uk,"Torrance, Keith/AAU-8723-2020","Torrance, Keith/0000-0002-2396-6575",National Research Council of ThailandNational Research Council of Thailand (NRCT); Kasetsart University; University of Strathclyde; British CouncilThe British Council in India,"We are grateful to the Mekong River Commission for courteously permitting us to use their data.

For simplicity, current models of Wolbachia dynamics and spread ignore ecologically complex factors such as the age structure of vector populations and overlapping vector generations. We developed a model including these factors to assess their impact on the process of Wolbachia spread into populations of three mosquito species (Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens). Depending on the mosquito species, Wolbachia parameters, released mosquito life stage and initial age structure of the target population, the number of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes that we predict would need to be released ranged from less than the threshold calculated by the simple model to a 10-30-fold increase. Transgenic releases into age-structured populations, which is an expectation for wild mosquitoes, will be difficult and depending on the circumstances may not be economically or logistically feasible due to the large number of infected mosquitoes that must be released. Our results support the perspective that understanding ecological factors is critical for designing transgenic vector-borne disease control strategies. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, I used a manipulative field experiment in a temperate subtidal marine system to explore the implications of diversity loss at multiple trophic levels for ecosystem functioning and food web structure. The four manipulated predators included the small painted goby and common prawn, which are also fed on by the larger black goby and shore crab. Antagonistic interactions between the manipulated predators (e.g., intraguild predation, intimidation, interference competition) limited their negative effects on the rest of the food web. Top-down control was so suppressed at the highest level of multitrophic diversity that the resulting food webs were as complex and productive as those containing no manipulated predators. Negative interactions between the predators weakened as multitrophic diversity decreased, however, resulting in stronger consumption of lower trophic levels and a simpler food web with lower rates of two key ecosystem processes: primary production and decomposition. These results show how indirect interactions between predators on multiple trophic levels help to promote the complexity and functioning of natural systems.","[O'Gorman, Eoin J.] Univ Essex, Sch Life Sci, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England","O'Gorman, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Essex, Sch Life Sci, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",e.ogorman@essex.ac.uk,"O'Gorman, Eoin/I-6744-2012","O'Gorman, Eoin/0000-0003-4507-5690","Irish Research CouncilIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology; British Ecological Society [SEPG/3535/4338]; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L011840/1]","Many thanks to Jesus Fernandez, Maike Pohlmann, Claire Passarelli, Marion Twomey, and Ute Jacob for field assistance and O ' rla McLaughlin for sample processing.

This ecological complexification results in better ecosystem thermodynamic performance indicated by lower temperature. In a brief period of evolutionary time human-induced disturbance has altered profoundly the structure and functioning of the Earth System, i.e. ecological simplification. The objective is to understand whether remote sensing data can be considered appropriate proxy indicators to test if more mature and complex ecosystems have higher entropy production rates which lead to lower and attenuated ecosystem temperatures. Simple remote sensing measurements of Madeira Island for Thermal Infrared Radiation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were used to analyse the surface temperature and biomass cover of Madeira ecosystems spectrum of different states of human-induced disturbance. The findings revealed it was possible to distinguish between ecosystem types using thermodynamic indicators, where older ecosystems with more complex structures exhibit more attenuated lower average temperatures. It was also found that habitat heterogeneity can represent either artificial (human) or natural disturbance with opposite consequences in the ecosystem thermal signature, i.e. lower temperature when natural disturbance and higher if anthropogenic disturbance. Simple thermal remote sensing data can be used as systemic indicator of ecosystem health by reflecting it levels of eco-exergy, i.e the available work energy in the ecosystem.","[Avelar, David; Ulm, Florian; Penha-Lopes, Gil] Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, cE3c Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes, Lisbon, Portugal; [Avelar, David; Garrett, Pedro] 2adapt Climate Adaptat Serv, Lisbon, Portugal; [Avelar, David; Hobson, Peter] Writtle Univ Coll, Ctr Econ & Ecosyst Management, Chelmsford, Essex, England","Avelar, D (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, cE3c Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes, Lisbon, Portugal.; Avelar, D (corresponding author), 2adapt Climate Adaptat Serv, Lisbon, Portugal.; Avelar, D (corresponding author), Writtle Univ Coll, Ctr Econ & Ecosyst Management, Chelmsford, Essex, England.",dnavelar@fc.ul.pt,"Penha-Lopes, Gil/N-1475-2015","Penha-Lopes, Gil/0000-0002-1024-1954; Ulm, Florian/0000-0002-1137-0651","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [PD/BD/52595/2014, PD/BD/106061/2015]; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [IF/00940/2015]","We would like to thank Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) for supporting the PhD grant PD/BD/52595/2014 of DA, PhD grant PD/BD/106061/2015 of FU, as well as FCT Investigator contract (IF/00940/2015) of GPL.

A total of 117 fishes comprising of 52 cyprinids and 65 catfishes were randomly collected from the Mekong River from 5 stations: Chiang Rai, Loei, Nongkhai, Nakhon Phanom and Ubonratchathani. The health of the fish collected in December and April, winter and summer respectively, was evaluated. All fish from the 5 stations developed pathologic lesions with the same characteristics in their livers, kidneys and spleen. In the liver, there was vacuolation of hepatocytes, accumulation of brownish-green granules in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, necrosis of hepatocytes, granuloma formation and angiogenesis. Kidney lesions consisted of glomerular degeneration, necrosis and focal hyperplasia of renal tubules. In the spleen, there were haemorrhage, melanomacrophage centre infiltration and necrosis of the red pulp and white pulp. The pathologic severity of the catfish was found to be more severe than in the cyprinids and the catfish collected in summer were less healthy than the catfish collected in the winter. These histopathological appearances might arise from the fish feeding on the benthos and thereby accumulating toxic pollutants in their organs. The activities of the serum enzymes, Glutamic Oxalacetic Transaminase (GOT) and Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (GPT), were markedly increased, indicating detoxification activity. The highest activity of GOT found in the cyprinids from Chiang Rai 365.30 U/L whereas in the catfish from Nakhon Phanom the activity was 300.73 U/L. The highest GPT activity found in the cyprinids from Nakhon Phanom was 203.23 U/L where as in the catfish from the same station was GPT 389.77 U/L. According to the results from this study, catfish collected from Chiang Rai, Nakhon Phanom and Ubonratchathani showed more severe pathological changes than catfish from the other stations. Fish organs and river water were analysed for Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals. The fish organs showed bioaccumulation of these toxic pollutants. BioConcentration Factors (BCFs) were calculated. Therefore an attempt is made to correlate these findings to the Mekong study in general.","[Keenan, Helen E.; Sakultantimetha, Arthit; Bangkedphol, Sornnarin; Gaines, Alec F.] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Civil Engn, David Livingstone Ctr Sustainabil, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Phanwichien, Kantimanee; Masawang, Kamonporn; Lauhachinda, Nitaya; Songsasen, Apisit] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Sci, Bangkok, Thailand; [Pradermwong, Apichart] Mahidol Univ, Fac Sci, Bangkok 10400, Thailand","Keenan, HE (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Dept Civil Engn, David Livingstone Ctr Sustainabil, Graham Hills Bldg, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",h.e.keenan@strath.ac.uk,,,,,,22,4,4,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1093-4529,,,J ENVIRON SCI HEAL A,J.

Key to this discussion is spatial planning and the concept of space. This paper touches on this concept by highlighting the challenges of applying absolute boundaries (as a representation of absolute space) to demarcate static zones within the context of complex and dynamic social-ecological systems.

The coffee pest, Leucoptera coffeella, is particularly problematical in Puerto Rico, but is usually held under control in Mexico. A variety of arboreal ants are effective predators in Mexico, but are limited in an indirect fashion by the common aggressive arboreal ant, Azteca sericeasur. In Puerto Rico this species does not occur, suggesting that the small arboreal ants might be more effective predators there than in Mexico. However, the contingency of large population densities of Anoline lizards is well-known as a major biological control force for the leaf miner. Ants, especially the non-native Wasmannia auropunctata, have a negative effect on the lizards. Surveying ants and coffee leaf miners in 25 coffee farms in Puerto Rico, we investigate the effect of ants, in particular W. auropunctata, on the coffee leaf miner, and find that this ant species has a positive relationship with the miner. In a more detailed spatial study of two farms, surveys of anoline lizards show no significant negative relationship between the lizards and W. auropunctata on a per plant basis. However, we found a significantly lower abundance of lizards on patches dominated by this ant, suggesting that W auropunctata indirectly protects the coffee leaf miner against this potential lizard predator. Thus, the structural complexity of a trait-mediated indirect effect occurs both in Mexico and Puerto Rico and potentially limits the effectiveness of biological control elements, but the contingencies are distinct in the two sites.","[Perfecto, Ivette; Vandermeer, John] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St,Dana Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hajian-Forooshani, Zachary; White, Alexa; Vandermeer, John] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Perfecto, I (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St,Dana Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",perfecto@umich.edu,,,"United State Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2017-67019-26292, 2018-67030-28239]",This work was supported by United State Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture grants numbers 2017-67019-26292 and 2018-67030-28239.,,32,1,1,2,23,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-8809,1873-2305,,AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON,Agric.

This study of a social-ecological regime shift, from a prosperous paddy cultivated region within the north bank of the Upper Brahmaputra Valley to a sediment deposited wasteland, unravels the complex relations between narratives of a problem and purposeful action. It is found that policy and practice solutions may not always be grounded in the problem situation but can be shaped by wider discourses and social learning. The study illustrates the continuation of engineering solutions without deeper understanding of their influence on social dynamics, the typification of community behaviour with an ignorance of cultural legacies, and a lack of prioritization of adaptation needs in the novel social-ecological conditions of the region. The conceptual frameworks of flood control debates contribute to distinct discourses influencing policy and praxis, while the discontented riparian community is motivated, by actors influenced by identity and space politics, towards political autonomy. Such influences of opposing discourses may reinforce the narrative of a trust gap between the Indian polity and its Northeast Region. The study further identifies a latent capacity for flexibility in the community, which requires more attention from policy and praxis to explore management solutions in such a complex social-ecological system. The paper argues for science, policy and practice engagements in such contexts and the use of transdisciplinary heuristics for their design to facilitate shared understanding.

However, its analysis has been mostly theoretical with few empirical studies. Complex systems share three features: radical openness (the system cannot be understood unless an extended, global, environment is considered), radical uncertainty (emergence and non-linearity make them impossible to be fully predictable) and contextuality (no unique way to know them). Social-ecological systems listed as important under international treaties, such as wetlands within the Ramsar Convention, share these features, which can be explored using case studies. In this article, we explore the complexities derived from the 2004 ecological change (i.e. the local collapse of an emblematic bird species) in the Carlos Anwandter Sanctuary, a Chilean coastal wetland, by means of two ten-year windows (scientific publications and Internet web pages). We based our analysis on the question: what is the state of knowledge, ten years after its ecological change? Results show many answers; science has several hypotheses with low testing possibilities. Still, civil society decided that only one (a forestry company guilty of producing the change) is valid. We discuss the role of international organizations when dealing with social-ecological conflicts and identify the conundrum that can develop in response to how these are handled.","[Marin, V.

It is an iconic element of the Australo-Papuan avifauna and also occurs in Indonesia and on remote Pacific Ocean islands. Building on previous molecular studies that have pioneered a renewed understanding of the family's circumscription and systematics, we present an updated phylogenetic and systematics synthesis of honeyeaters derived from 112 mostly Australian, New Guinean and Wallacean species- and subspecies-rank taxa aligned across 9246 positions spanning four mitochondrial and four nuclear genes. We affirm many of the recent changes advocated to the group's genus-level systematics and offer some further refinements. The group's radiation appears to coincide broadly with the aridification of Australia in the Miocene, consistent with the time of origin of diversification of extant lineages in several other groups of Australian organisms. Most importantly, the complexity of the biogeography underlying the group's spectacular radiation, especially within Australia, is now apparent. Foremost among such examples is the robust evidence indicating that multiple, independent lineages of honeyeaters, including several monotypic genera, are endemic to the Australian arid zone, presumably having diverged and evolved within it. Also apparent and warranting further study are the phenotypic diversity among close relatives and the remarkably disjunct distributions within some clades, perhaps implying extinction of geographically intermediate lineages. Given such complexity, understanding the evolution of this radiation, which has thus far been intractable, relies on integration of molecular data with morphology, ecology and behaviour.","[Joseph, Leo] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Australian Natl Wildlife Collect, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Toon, Alicia] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Nyari, Arpad S.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Zool, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Longmore, N.

Assisted migration (AM) is the translocation of species or genotypes from their current ranges to areas predicted to have a supportive future climate. Although correlations of species ranges with climate are traditionally used to explore AM potential, successful AM strategies will have to consider many other variables. In this article, we review recent research that informs the complexity of AM decisions. Local microenvironment, herbivory, and intraspecific interactions frequently outweigh climate in determining species establishment and survival. Species adopt several strategies to cope with drought, heat, and cold, but translocated genetic material can display cryptic maladaptation when challenged by extreme, out-of-range weather events. Phenology, photoperiod, and climate are related in complex, often provenance-specific ways.

Qualitative conceptual modeling was found to be useful in revealing the underlying perceptions of ecosystem functioning for these novice scientists. Preliminary results showed improvement in their ability to recognize and apply some of the attributes of complex ecosystem: non-linear feedback loops, hierarchical organization, patterns illustrating the spatial arrangements of species diversity. In addition to using models, teachers used peer-learning techniques.

Alongside this participation growth is the burden of running-related injury (RRI). Over the past four decades, traditional scientific research applications have primarily attempted to isolate discrete risk factors for RRI using observational study designs as commonly used in public health epidemiology. Unfortunately, only very few randomised controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy associated with a well-specified RRI prevention intervention. Even though the knowledge about risk factors as generated in observational studies is valuable for better understanding why RRI develops, it nonetheless means that there remains a major knowledge gap about how best to prevent it, especially in a way that fully addresses all causal factors. Alongside the continuing use of traditional scientific approaches, a particular systems ergonomics methodology should also be considered in light of its potential to visualise the complete distance running system. This article adapts the Systems Theoretic Accident Mapping and Processes (STAMP) model to the RRI research prevention context. The direct application of STAMP might offer new knowledge about how to prevent RRI, such as exposing questions around the feasibility of adopting novel injury prevention interventions that do not directly target runners themselves.","[Hulme, A.; Finch, C.

The chronical stress imposed by air pollution, key factor ozone, is - for the time being hypothetically - derived as a function of the altitude above sea level from the measured values obtained from neighbouring measuring stations. Highly significant, really functional relationships of damage to the velocity of flow of the pollutant-clean air mixture, the so-called ''air-pollutant flux'', represented by the factors of altitude above sea level, age of stand and reduced stand density, are proved by the analysis. The models of response so formalized in order to quantity the actual state of damage led to the first hypothetical models of medium-term damage prognosis, based upon the presence of the tree species spruce which is diminishing by area as a function of the increasing duration of air pollution stress; the reduction in stand density due to the damage follows the cumulative function of the probability integral after Gauss, thus a rend of biological relevance.

Herbivores promote settlement by reducing algal competition. This study investigates whether invertebrate herbivory might be modulated by other ecological factors such as substrata variations and coral species identity. Methodology/Principal Findings: The experiment was conducted at the Flower Garden Banks, one of the few Atlantic reefs not experiencing considerable degradation. Tiles of differing texture and orientation were kept in bins surrounded by reef (24 m). Controls contained no herbivores while treatment bins contained urchins (Diadema antillarum) or herbivorous gastropods (Cerithium litteratum). Juvenile corals settling naturally were monitored by photography for 14 months to evaluate the effects of invertebrate herbivory and substratum properties. Herbivory reduced algae cover in urchin treatments. Two genera of brooding coral juveniles were observed, Agaricia and Porites, both of which are common but not dominant on adjacent reef. No broadcast spawning corals were observed on tiles. Overall, juveniles were more abundant in urchin treatments and on vertical, rough textured surfaces. Although more abundant, Agaricia juveniles were smaller in urchin treatments, presumably due to destructive overgrazing. Still, Agaricia growth increased with herbivory and substrata texture-orientation interactions were observed with reduced growth on rough tiles in control treatments and increased growth on vertical tiles in herbivore treatments. In contrast to Agaricia, Porites juveniles were larger on horizontal tiles, irrespective of herbivore treatment. Mortality was affected by substrata orientation with vertical surfaces increasing coral survival. Conclusions/Significance: We further substantiate that invertebrate herbivores play major roles in early settlement processes of corals and highlight the need for deeper understanding of ecological interactions modulating these effects. The absence of broadcast-spawning corals, even on a reef with consistently high coral cover, continues to expose the recruitment failure of these reef-building corals throughout the Caribbean.","[Davies, Sarah W.; Matz, Mikhail V.] Univ Texas Austin, Integrat Biol Sect, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Davies, Sarah W.; Vize, Peter D.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Davies, SW (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Integrat Biol Sect, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",daviessw@gmail.com,"Matz, Mikhail V/K-4392-2017","Matz, Mikhail V/0000-0001-5453-9819",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) PGS-MNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); University of Calgary; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1054766],"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) PGS-M to SWD; ACCESS Funding from the University of Calgary to SWD; National Science Foundation grant DEB-1054766 to MVM.

The history, designation and current management of Giant Sequoia National Monument is emblematic of this shift from proximate impacts to a recognition of more systemic, landscape-level phenomena.

In general, we can say that this concept has important influence on the spheres of economics and politics; these formulate demands towards the science, and consecutively, the science efforts to answer these demands. The paper is aimed at two goals: the first one is to zoom in on the landscape-ecological concept of ESS by the geosystem approach, for the correct understanding of the basic terms, such as as ecosystem, geosystem, landscape, utility values, and services. The second goal is to present examples of several types of ESS evaluation in different study areas using the integrated landscape-ecological (geosystem) approach. The methods used are based on the geosystem approach to the landscape; the process is based on the methods of landscape ecological planning.

We explicitly aim to highlight the dynamics of transmission that are still largely unknown. Recent knowledge gathered from research in Africa and Europe explains the very focal nature of the virus, and indicates that research on the ecology of the virus in the inter-epidemic periods of the disease has not yet been addressed. Hyalomma spp. ticks have been incriminated in the transmission of the virus under field conditions, but the role of other ticks found infected in nature remains to be tested under experimental conditions. Published evidence suggests that the increase in human cases reported in the Balkans, Turkey, and Russia is perhaps less due to the effect of changes in climate, but rather result from the impact of yet unexplored mechanisms of amplification that might be supported by wild animal hosts. Assessment of the available data suggests that epidemics in Eastern Europe are not the result of a spreading viral wave, but more likely are due to a combination of factors, such as habitat abandonment, landscape fragmentation, and proliferation of wildlife hosts that have exacerbated prevalence rates in tick vectors. There is an urgent need to empirically demonstrate these assumptions as well as the role of birds in introducing infected ticks, and also to evaluate the potential for survival of introduced ticks. Either a replacement of the pathogenic virus in the western Mediterranean or a lack of westward dissemination of infected tick populations may explain the absence of the virus in Western Europe.","[Estrada-Pena, Agustin] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Parasitol, Fac Vet Med, E-50013 Zaragoza, Spain; [Jameson, Lisa; Medlock, Jolyon] Hlth Protect Agcy, Med Entomol & Zoonoses Ecol, Microbial Risk Assessment, Emergency Response Dept, Salisbury, Wilts, England; [Vatansever, Zati] Kafkas Univ, Dept Parasitol, Fac Vet Med, Kars, Turkey; [Tishkova, Farida] Minist Hlth Republ Tajikistan, Tajik Res Inst Prevent Med, Dushanbe, Tajikistan","Estrada-Pena, A (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Dept Parasitol, Fac Vet Med, Miguel Servet 177, E-50013 Zaragoza, Spain.",aestrada@unizar.es,"vatansever, zati/A-2344-2016","vatansever, zati/0000-0003-3460-3849; Estrada Pena, Agustin/0000-0001-7483-046X; Jameson, Lisa Jane/0000-0002-6409-3547","ArboZoonet; International Network for Capacity Building for the Control of Emerging Viral Vector Borne Zoonotic Diseases, under the European Union FP7 framework [211757]","Parts of this article were the result of the inspiration of the people engaged in the understanding of the ecology of CCHF in Eastern Europe.

Cultural landscapes are the results of such coevolutive processes. A better understanding of the mechanisms that have assured along the millennia, the maintenance of biological as well as ecological processes seems of extreme importance for our future survival. In North America, a frontier mentality persists in the cultural mindset and rich biodiversity is associated only with remote areas, reflecting a model of an empty world in which human development is completely isolated from the natural (wild) processes. This vision is in contrast with the full world vision of the Mediterranean dwellings. Plasticity, adaptation to disturbance, and the persisting of biological refugia can be considered the most relevant factors responsible for the Mediterranean dynamics. These factors are rare or impossible to find in the North America context from which the dominance of the economic capital over the natural and cultural ones is a very popular model exported worldwide. In this commentary the full world paradigm is presented as an extension of the concept of resilience and ascendancy to propose a new grammar that incorporates self-organisation of natural and human dominated systems into a process of diffuse globalisation of economics and human behaviour.

It is hypothesized that pollution may be adversely affecting the water and sediment quality, which threatens the short and long-term use of this major river system. This directly impacts on the health and population of the aquatic life and ultimately human health and the economy for both countries is affected. The quality of the river can be assessed from various chemical and physical parameters, such as PAHs and metals content of both the water and the sediment. The introduction of Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) allows comparison of the values obtained with the guidelines. Furthermore the modelling program EPISUITE was used to determine the environmental partitioning of pollutants within the different environmental compartments. Using the data produced for PAHs and metals the experimental model was compared to the default model. This involved experimentally measuring the log Koc for Mekong sediments and from this determining the log Kow. High availability in sediment of pollutants may lead to greater biomagnification in bethnic fish, which may then be hazardous for human consumption even if it is safe for the species that is accumulating pollutants. The potential for this is shown by the calculated accumulation in biota Cbio values exceeding both the Chronic value (ChrV) and Lethal Concentration 50 (LC50) for fish in the Mekong River. When compared to the EQS guidelines the amount of some PAHs, cadmium and lead in sediment were above the lowest effect level but below the severe effect level.","[Keenan, Helen E.; Bangkedphol, Sornnarin; Sakultantimetha, Arthit] Univ Strathclyde, David Livingstone Ctr Sustainabil, Dept Civil Engn, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Songsasen, Apisit] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Bangkok, Thailand","Keenan, HE (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, David Livingstone Ctr Sustainabil, Dept Civil Engn, Graham Hills Bldg, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",h.e.keenan@strath.ac.uk,,,Center for Innovation Chemistry; Postgraduate Education and Research Program in Chemistry (PERCH-CIC); Kasetsart University Research and Development Institute (KURDI); British Council (Thailand),"Center for Innovation Chemistry: Postgraduate Education and Research Program in Chemistry (PERCH-CIC), Kasetsart University Research and Development Institute (KURDI) and the British Council (Thailand) for financial support.",,18,4,4,0,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1093-4529,,,J ENVIRON SCI HEAL A,J.

The number of modes of life actually utilized specifies realized ecospace. Owing to constraints of effectiveness and efficiency the modern marine fauna utilizes only about half the potential number of modes of life, two-thirds of which (62 of 92) are utilized by animals with readily preserved, mineralized hard parts. Realized ecospace has increased markedly since the early evolution of animal ecosystems. The Ediacaran fauna utilized at most 12 modes of life, with just two practised by skeletal organisms. A total of 30 modes of life are recorded in the Early and Middle Cambrian, 19 of which were utilized by skeletal organisms. The other 11 are documented from soft-bodied animals preserved in the Chengjiang and Burgess Shale Konservat-Lagerstatten. The number of modes of life utilized by skeletal organisms increased by more than 50 per cent during the Ordovician radiation to a Late Ordovician total of 30.

In this study, we used a combination of field surveys, remote sensing, census data and spatial analysis to investigate the interrelationships among geographical and social-economic variables across 328 different urban structural units (USUs) and how they may influence the distributions of urban forest cover, plant diversity and abundance, within the central urban area of Beijing, China. We found that the urban green space coverage varied substantially across different types of USUs, with higher in agricultural lands (N = 15), parks (N = 46) and lowest in utility zones (N = 36). The amount of urban green space within USUs declines exponentially with the distance to urban center. Our study suggested that geographical, social and economic factors were closely related with each other in urban ecological systems, and have important impacts on urban forest coverage and abundance. The percentage of forest as well as high and low density urban areas were mainly responsible for variations in the data across all USUs and all land use/land cover types, and thus are important constituents and ecological indicators for understanding and modeling urban environment. Herb richness is more strongly correlated with tree and shrub density than with tree and shrub richness (r = -0.472, p < 0.05). However, other geographic and socioeconomic factors showed no significant relationships with urban plant diversity or abundance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This flows exchange allows marine ecosystems to operate at different scales acting as dissipative structures, building natural capital stocks capable of generating several ecosystem services vital for human well-being. Humans derive a wide range of goods and services from marine ecosystems while, at the same time, generate several impacts causing biodiversity loss and seriously affecting their capacity to provide benefits to humans. Effective management strategies are crucial to conserve healthy and diverse marine and coastal ecosystems, maintain the valuable functions and services they provide, and allow for sustainable human activities. In recent years, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been increasingly acknowledged worldwide as important tools to conserve biodiversity and achieve human well-being and sustainable development goals. Assessing the value of natural capital and ecosystem services is crucial to raise awareness on their importance, support conservation strategies, and ensure the sustainable management of marine ecosystems. This study aimed at calculating biomass and emergy-based indicators to assess the value of natural capital stocks in a Mediterranean MPA. The assessment was performed through a biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model fed with field biomass data collected through ad hoc sampling campaigns performed in the MPA. Four main macro-habitats were investigated: sciaphilic hard bottom (coralligenous bioconstructions), photophilic hard bottom, soft bottom, and Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds. The biomass density of the main autotrophic and heterotrophic taxonomic groups identified in the four macro-habitats of the MPA was evaluated. Based on this biomass matrix, the emergy value of natural capital stocks was assessed. The Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds habitat showed the highest biophysical value (2.32.1019 sej) at MPA scale, while coralligenous bioconstructions resulted the habitat with the highest biophysical value per unit area (2.72.1012 sej m-2). In addition, to complement the biophysical assessment with an economic perspective, the emergy-based indicators were converted into monetary units. The total value of natural capital of the whole MPA resulted in about 46 Meuro. The results of this study can support local managers and policy makers in the development of management strategies to ensure nature conservation and sustainable human activities. They can be also used as a benchmark for the assessment of natural capital value at larger scales in support of a proper consideration and inclusion of nature value into processes of policy making.","[Buonocore, Elvira; Russo, Giovanni F.; Franzese, Pier Paolo] Parthenope Univ Naples, Dept Sci & Technol, UNESCO Chair Environm Resources & Sustainable Dev, Via F Petrarca 80, I-80123 Naples, Italy; [Buonocore, Elvira; Russo, Giovanni F.; Franzese, Pier Paolo] CoNISMa, Piazzale Flaminio 9, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Buia, Maria Cristina] Ischia Marine Ctr Villa Dohrn, Dept Integrat Marine Ecol, Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Naples, Italy","Franzese, PP (corresponding author), Parthenope Univ Naples, Dept Sci & Technol, UNESCO Chair Environm Resources & Sustainable Dev, Via F Petrarca 80, I-80123 Naples, Italy.",,,,,,,63,1,1,3,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1476-945X,1476-9840,,ECOL COMPLEX,Ecol.

The focal species was the threespot damselfish, Stegastes planifrons,a territorial coral reef fish that experiences a high degree of variation in community composition. Field observations of individual threespot damselfish showed a significant increase in the amount of time spent on active territorial defense when the community contained greater proportions of food competitors. Territorial behavior also increased concurrently with higher species diversity in the community. However, no behavioral change was observed in response to the total number of fish entering the defended territory, suggesting that threespot damselfish are responding to more complex environmental cues associated with community structure rather than simple density.","Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Abrey, CA (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",abrey@u.washington.edu,,,,,,29,4,4,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

The location is Jiwozhai, Guizhou Province, in the Dushan Formation. A total of 83 species (including 23 undetermined species) belonging to 44 genera of reef organisms were identified, based on a detailed statistical analysis from 28 quadrats on the vertical section of the patch reef. The main reef builders are laminar and encrusting-behaviour stromatoporoids, laminar tabulate corals, and laminar encrusting chaetetids, forming coverstones to build the reef framework, while abundant massive and branching tabulate corals and solitary rugose corals are also important for the formation of the reef by filling the spaces between the components of the coverstones. Reef dwellers including brachiopods, bryozoans, tubeworms, calcified cyanobacteria and gastropods, are only scarcely distributed in the Jiwozhai patch reef, having little impact on the distribution pattern. Consistent with the densely distributed species at Jiwozhai, complex ecological relationships, including extensive encrustations, spatial competition, and symbiosis have also been found among different organisms. The high biodiversity level of the Jiwozhai patch reef in platform interior emphasizes that understanding of species richness and diversity of functional groups in different habitats is critical for Givetian reef ecosystem reconstruction. Location of the patch reef in a platform interior may be the reason for the high diversity biota. The results from the Jiwozhai patch reef are evidence for a stable reef structure with evenly distributed major reef-frame builders and complex ecological relationships. The high level of species diversity is a common feature in South China, as well localities of many other palaeocontinents during the Givetian Period.","[Huang, Jiayuan; Liang, Kun; Jeon, Juwan; Qiao, Li; Ma, Junye; Li, Yue; Wang, Yujue; Wang, Yao; Ma, Jiaxin; Luo, Mao; Qie, Wenkun] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jiayuan; Liang, Kun; Jeon, Juwan; Qiao, Li; Ma, Junye; Li, Yue; Wang, Yujue; Wang, Yao; Ma, Jiaxin; Luo, Mao; Qie, Wenkun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Palaeoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jiayuan; Wang, Yujue; Ma, Jiaxin] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yue] Guizhou Univ, Sch Resources & Environm, Guiyang 550003, Peoples R China; [Liao, Weihua; Guo, Wen; Song, Junjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Kershaw, Stephen] Brunel Univ, Dept Life Sci, Kingston Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Jeon, Juwan; Wang, Yao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci UCAS, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Tu, Bing; Tian, Yang] China Geol Survey, Wuhan Ctr Geol Survey, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China","Liang, K; Qie, WK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Liang, K; Qie, WK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Palaeoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.",jyhuang@nigpas.ac.cn; kliang@nigpas.ac.cn; gzyuewang@126.com; whliao@nigpas.ac.cn; wenguo@nigpas.ac.cn; Stephen.Kershaw@brunel.ac.uk; jjeon@nigpas.ac.cn; liqiao@nigpas.ac.cn; jjsong@nigpas.ac.cn; jyma@nigpas.ac.cn; yueli@nigpas.ac.cn; tbing502@126.com; 41834572@qq.com; yujuewang@nigpas.ac.cn; yaowang@nigpas.ac.cn; jxma@nigpas.ac.cn; maoluo@nigpas.ac.cn; wkqie@nigpas.ac.cn,"Qiao, li/AAB-1489-2021; LUO, MAO/L-5590-2016","LUO, MAO/0000-0002-6340-7786; Jeon, Juwan/0000-0003-4827-306X","Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41772004, 41802002]; Geological Survey Projects of China Geological Survey [DD20201121, 12120113063200]","We sincerely thank two anonymous reviewers and editor Thomas Algeo for their constructive comments and suggestions.

We formalize this mechanism in a theoretical model that portrays a small community having joint access to a common pool resource. The diffusion of norms of cooperation takes place via interpersonal relations, while individual agents face the temptation of higher profits by overexploiting the resource. Agents remain conditionally cooperative, unless other individuals are misbehaving already. We can observe a bubble of conditional cooperators slowly building up followed by a sudden burst, which means that a transition from a cooperative social norm to non-cooperation occurs. Interestingly, in some parameter regions alternative stable states and limit cycles arise. The latter implies that the same community goes through such a transition repeatedly over long time spans - history thus repeats itself in the form of the creation and erosion of social capital.

In this context, measures of structural complexity derived from close-range repeat photography may form a part of the solution. Moreover, recent mathematical tools, such as recurrence plots and recurrence quantification analysis (RP-RQA), are becoming accessible for characterizing the multivariate dynamics of natural systems given short, stochastic and non-stationary series. In this study, a total of 9360 grey-level digital images were recorded on a weekly basis across 72 sites in an old-growth forest ecosystem and analyzed for structural complexity. Structural complexity was assessed using an information theoretic measure (mean information gain). The effect of the scene scale on the observed dynamics was verified across a gradient of forest descriptors and light habitats. Multiscale dynamics responded nonlinearly to changes in scene scale. whereas seasonal trends in structural complexity showed a range of deterministic and stochastic behaviours. The determinism of multiscale time-series was related to sapling density, tree cover, and tree species richness. The sensitivity and flexibility of the RP-RQA approach applied to proxy measures of structural complexity in digital images forms an efficient methodology which might be used for actively monitoring forest ecosystems. This field study is one of the first to demonstrate that old-growth forest ecosystems behave like complex systems exhibiting nonlinear vegetation structure and dynamics across scales.

Ecological approaches to the study of firms have existed for over 100 years, and have been increasingly popular during the past 40 years, especially since the pioneering works of Hannan and Freeman on one hand, and Aldrich on the other. This paper, in keeping with recent developments elsewhere in mainstream ecology outlines and positions the theoretical and philosophical foundations of an alternative ecological approach, autecology, that has not yet been formulated for the study of firms. The autecological approach affords the individual firm more autonomy in creating its own future evolutionary trajectory. The idea of an ecological complex is developed to provide clear focus on what is central to the application of autecology to the study of firms. The paper also considers several emergent research opportunities that highlight the potential value of employing an autecological approach to the study of firms.","[Jones, Colin] Univ Tasmania, Australian Innovat Res Ctr, Hobart, Australia","Jones, C (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Australian Innovat Res Ctr, Hobart, Australia.",Colin.Jones@utas.edu.au,,,,,,67,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1385-3457,1572-963X,,J MANAG GOV,J.

The significance of this nestedness measure is tested against a null model that constraints matrix fill to observed values and retains the distribution of number of events.

This work formalizes their relationship within statistical theory with a conceptual framework that includes five parameters: L, K, S, D, and R. These parameters provide an increasing degree of specificity about a distribution as they are enumerated and accord with measurements of system extent, richness, evenness, variance, and scale-covariance. Moreover, a mathematical and physical basis for understanding heterogeneity and homogeneity is Outlined in terms of Brownian motion, where the Hurst exponent H and the notion of variance are utilized to delimit these two states. Spatial and temporal patterns are quantified and classified according to the mathematical and physical basis at multiple scales, as well as within the conceptual framework that can be applied to other metrics. Concepts of scale-invariance and scale-covariance are discussed in terms of hierarchy theory. It is argued that in hierarchical distributions, we should expect more than simple scale-covariance; we should expect division by a transitional state that divides heterogeneity from homogeneity at some scale. By revisiting the underlying statistical theory behind these concepts, a more efficient approach to quantifying ecological distributions can result. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, earlier studies have focused on only one habitat type, disregarding forest-steppe heterogeneity. We examined the compositional and species richness trends along a centre-to-periphery gradient in Hungary, across multiple habitats. We also investigated abiotic environmental factors, such as climate, soil, and land-use history, which potentially underlie the observed vegetation phenomena. The effects of the gradient on the overall species richness and the richness of different species groups were studied using generalized linear models. Changes in species composition and environmental variables along the gradient were analysed using detrended correspondence analysis. There was an apparent increase in species richness in some habitats, although different species groups reacted differently along the gradient. Furthermore, there was a well-defined compositional turnover, which was associated with a change in climatic, soil, and land-use variables. The marked trends in species composition and richness may be explained by the transitional nature of forest-steppes, where many species may be close to their tolerance limits. Ongoing global warming may entail a significant decrease in species richness. However, this decrease may be mitigated by protecting the diversity of habitats and species groups, as some of them will better withstand increasing aridity. Preserving forest-steppe integrity may thus be understood as an insurance policy.","[Erdos, Laszlo; Bede-Fazekas, Akos; Szitar, Katalin; Kroel-Dulay, Gyorgy] MTA Ctr Ecol Res, Inst Ecol & Bot, Alkotmany Utca 2-4, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary; [Batori, Zoltan; Tolgyesi, Csaba] Univ Szeged, Dept Ecol, Kozep Fasor 52, H-6726 Szeged, Hungary; [Bede-Fazekas, Akos; Biro, Marianna] MTA Ctr Ecol Res, GINOP Sustainable Ecosyst Grp, Klebelsberg Kuno U 3, H-8237 Tihany, Hungary; [Daranyi, Nikoletta] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Cartog & Geoinformat, Pazmany Peter Setany 1-A, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Magness, Martin] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Plant Sci, Inst Biol, Holteigasse 6, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Pasztor, Laszlo] MTA Ctr Agr Res, Inst Soil Sci & Agr Chem, Herman Otto Ut 15, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary; [Sengl, Philipp] Civil Engn Off Kotler Umweltmanagement, Trafoss 20, A-8132 Pernegg Ad Mur, Austria","Erdos, L (corresponding author), MTA Ctr Ecol Res, Inst Ecol & Bot, Alkotmany Utca 2-4, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary.",erdos.laszlo@okologia.mta.hu,"Batori, Zoltan/M-3399-2018; Katalin, Szitar/AAE-3405-2021",,[OTKA PD 116114];  [GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00019];  [NKFIH K 124796],"LE was supported by grant OTKA PD 116114, ABF and MB by grant GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00019, and ZB by grant NKFIH K 124796.",,63,1,1,0,6,FLORISTISCH-SOZIOLOGISCHEN ARBEITSGEMEINSCHAFT E V,GOETTINGEN,"WILHELM-WEBER-STRASSE 2, GOETTINGEN, 00000, GERMANY",0722-494X,,,TUEXENIA,Tuexenia,,2019,,39,,,,,357,375,,,,19,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,JS1QZ,,,,,9/23/21,,,

Human impacts on the environment are multifaceted and can occur across distinct spatiotemporal scales. Ecological responses to environmental change are therefore difficult to predict, and entail large degrees of uncertainty. Such uncertainty requires robust tools for management to sustain ecosystem goods and services and maintain resilient ecosystems. 2. We propose an approach based on discontinuity theory that accounts for patterns and processes at distinct spatial and temporal scales, an inherent property of ecological systems. Discontinuity theory has not been applied in natural resource management and could therefore improve ecosystem management because it explicitly accounts for ecological complexity. 3. Synthesis and applications. We highlight the application of discontinuity approaches for meeting management goals. Specifically, discontinuity approaches have significant potential to measure and thus understand the resilience of ecosystems, to objectively identify critical scales of space and time in ecological systems at which human impact might be most severe, to provide warning indicators of regime change, to help predict and understand biological invasions and extinctions and to focus monitoring efforts. Discontinuity theory can complement current approaches, providing a broader paradigm for ecological management and conservation.","[Angeler, David G.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, Box 7050, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Allen, Craig R.] Univ Nebraska, US Geol Survey, Nebraska Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Barichievy, Chris] Zool Soc London, Regents Pk, London NW1 4RY, England; [Eason, Tarsha; Garmestani, Ahjond S.] US EPA, Natl Risk Management Res Lab, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA; [Graham, Nicholas A.

Given their historic importance in human development, floodplains have been exposed to a variety of pressures, which in combination have been instrumental in driving changes within these ecosystems. Here, we present an evidence-based framework to explore direct and indirect effects of pressures and stressors on floodplain ecosystems and test this structure within the urban landscape. Evidence was obtained from peer-reviewed scientific literature, focusing on effects of key pressures and stressors on receptors, including species composition (e.g., species presence-absence, diversity) and ecosystem function (e.g., biomass, decomposition). The strength of direct and indirect effects of individual and multiple stressors on biological receptors was quantified using two separate analyses: an evidence-weighted analysis and a quantitative network meta-analysis using data extracted from 131 studies. Results demonstrate the power of adopting a systematic framework to advance quantitative assessment of floodplain ecosystems affected by multiple stressors. While direct pathways were generally stronger and provided the core network skeleton, there were many more significant indirect pathways indicating evidence gaps in our mechanistic understanding of these processes. Indeed, the importance of indirect pathways (e.g. increase in impervious surface -> increase in the accumulation rate of sediment nutrients) suggests that embracing complexity in network meta-analysis is a necessary step in revealing a more complete snapshot of the network. Results from the weight-of-evidence approach generally mirrored the direct pathway structure and demonstrated the strength of incorporating study quality alongside data sufficiency. Networks illustrated novel disturbance pathways (e.g., decrease in habitat structure -> decrease in structure and function of aquatic and riparian assemblages) that can be used for hypothesis generation for future scientific enquiries. Our results highlight the broader applicability of adopting the proposed framework for assessing complex environments, such as floodplains.

It included numerous faunal extinctions, widespread deforestation and the erosion and re-deposition of sediments, to which are attributed various consequences for cultural development. The issue considered here is whether as explanation of anthropogenic change could extend to variations in settlement history between Remote Oceanic islands. Most of those were inhabited continuously, especially in the older settled area, but in East Polynesia settlement is thought to have declined on several islands and its was abandoned in many others. Consideration of the type and scale of anthropogenic changes indicates no correlation with variations in settlement history. Anthropogenic changes might be regarded as constants of the settlement process. Late Holocene climatic patterns, ecological complexity and isolation with its effect on the availability of subsistence choices, may have been more influential variables.","Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Pacific & Asian Studies, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Anderson, A (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Pacific & Asian Studies, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,,,,,82,85,86,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0043-8243,1470-1375,,WORLD ARCHAEOL,World Archaeol.,FEB,2002,33,3,,,,,375,390,,,,16,Archaeology,Archaeology,529XV,,,,,9/23/21,,,

The symbiosis is thought to have afforded green plants the opportunity to invade dry land ca 450 Ma ago and the vast majority of extant terrestrial plants retain this association. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi perform various ecological functions in exchange for host photosynthetic carbon that almost always contribute to the fitness of hosts from an individual to community level. Recent AM fungal research, increasingly delving into the 'Black Box', suggests that species in this phylum may play a key facilitative role in below-ground micro-and meso-organism community dynamics, even more perhaps, that of a bioengineer. The ubiquitous nature of the symbiosis in extant flora and the fact that variations from the AM symbiosis are recent events suggest that Glomeromycota and plant roots coevolved. This review considers aspects of AM fungal ecology emphasizing past and present importance of the phylum in niche to global ecosystem function. Nutrient exchange, evolution, taxonomy, phenology, below-ground microbial interaction, propagule dissemination, invasive plants interactions, the potential role in phytoremediation and some of the factors affecting AM fungal biology are discussed. We conclude that it is essential to include AM association in any study of higher plants in natural environments in order to provide an holistic understanding of ecosystems.","[Willis, A.; Harris, P.

It is the main example for Europe's increasing desire to conserve aquatic ecosystems. Ironically, since c. 1975 the increasing adoption of EU directives has been accompanied by a decreasing interest of, for example, the Dutch government to assess the quality of its coastal and marine ecosystems. The surveillance and monitoring started in NL in 1971 has declined since the 1980s resulting in a 35% reduction of sampling stations. Given this and interruptions the remaining data series is considered to be insufficient for purposes other than trend analysis and compliance. The Dutch marine managers have apparently chosen a minimal (cost-effective) approach despite the WFD implicitly requiring the incorporation of the system's 'ecological complexity' in indices used to evaluate the ecological status of highly variable systems such as transitional and coastal waters. These indices should include both the community structure and system functioning and to make this really cost-effective a new monitoring strategy is required with a tailor-made programme. Since the adoption of the WFD in 2000 and the launching of the European Marine Strategy in 2002 (and the recently proposed Marine Framework Directive) we suggest reviewing national monitoring programmes in order to integrate water quality monitoring and biological monitoring and change from 'station oriented monitoring' to 'basin or system oriented monitoring' in combination with specific 'cause-effect' studies for highly dynamic coastal systems. Progress will be made if the collected information is integrated and aggregated in valuable tools such as structure-and functioning-oriented computer simulation models and Decision Support Systems. The development of ecological indices integrating community structure and system functioning, such as in Ecological Network Analysis, are proposed to meet a cost-effective approach at the national level and full assessment of the ecosystem status at the EU level. The WFD offers the opportunity to re-consider and re-invest in environmental research and monitoring. Using examples from the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom, the present paper therefore reviews marine monitoring and marine environmental research in combination and in the light of such major policy initiatives such as the WFD.

Ecosystem complexity and ultimately functionality depend on higher levels of biodiversity, biomass, heterogeneity and evolutionary potential, such as genes. These characteristics are also likely to promote system resilience and adaptive capacity, which are becoming increasingly important under global climate change. This paper proposes a global proxy-based index of ecosystem functionality (EFI). The results generated for all the main global biomes recorded highest index values for tropical and extratropical forest ecoregions. Out of the selected variables vegetation density, topographical heterogeneity and carbon storage demonstrated strong correlations with the ecosystem functionality index. It is argued that the ecosystem functionality index is not only useful for ecological research and conservation science but also as an effective prioritization scheme for biodiversity conservation at the landscape scale in times of rapid global environmental change. Furthermore, ecosystems that express high ecosystem functionality are also believed to have greater buffer and adaptive capacity and it is proposed that these parameters help to identify those ecosystems that will contribute toward global sustainability.

In exchange for honey-dew, the Azteca ant protects scale-insects that help control the devastating coffee-rust disease. The ant repels the adult ladybeetle but inadvertently protects its larvae, which devour scales to local extinction. The head-hunting fly paralyzes Azteca and opens a window of opportunity for the adult beetle to oviposit under scales, but also for a parasitoid wasp to kill the beetle larvae. Interactions can cascade or not towards APC.

Thus, the response to N deposition by plant communities can also be expected to vary in space and time. The total amount of deposition received by a plant community may vary regionally due to proximity to emission sources and locally due to vegetation structure. Temporal variation such as a seasonal peak in N deposition may coincide with specific life stages of the plant and drive community response to N deposition. Using the California oak savanna as a model ecosystem, a greenhouse experiment simulating realistic levels of N deposition received across the region was conducted to test the relative effects of N fertilization, soil type, light, and community mixture on the germination and seedling establishment of grasses. Seedling mixtures were composed of 3 common grass species-Stipa pulchra, Hordeum murinum, and Elymus caput-medusae-grown in monoculture and in 2- and 3-species combinations. Nitrogen fertilization alone had no effect on germination or seedling establishment, with one exception that high N increased seedling establishment of E. caput-medusae when that species was grown in monoculture. This limited effect of N deposition in a complex and realistic experimental setting indicated that deposition levels in oak savannas are not affecting most plants during early growth. Rather, early growth stages are species-specific and respond most strongly to neighbor identity.","[Tulloss, Elise M.; Cadenasso, Mary L.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Tulloss, EM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",emtulloss@ucdavis.edu,,,Department of Plant Sciences; College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences at UC Davis,"We thank Steven Silva at the UC Davis greenhouse facility, staff at research sites, and Cadenasso lab interns for their help and expertise in setting up and carrying out the experiment.

Our learning from the structure complexity of natural ecosystems can help us to redesign the structure of industrial system. Thus the materials and energy efficiency of industrial systems can be improved well to achieve the sustainable goals. In this paper, Structural Analysis Method for Industrial Ecosystems (SAMIE) is introduced and applied in the analysis of the structure complexity and efficiency of the industrial ecosystems. The industrial ecosystem is analyzed based on the industrial species' classification, which is analogous to the natural ecosystem. A set of indicators are developed to evaluate the industrial system, in order to explore the problems of structural complexity, identify the limiting factors of industrial ecosystem evolution, and strengthen the capacity of adaptation and self-organization. A case study on LuBei industrial ecosystem in China has been selected to apply the SAMIE approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In a reductionist approach, we may use predictions at the level of individual system components (e.g. species biomass), and combine them to generate predictions for system-level properties (e.g. ecosystem function). Here we show that this process of scaling up uncertain predictions to higher levels of organisation has a surprising consequence: it tends to systematically underestimate the magnitude of system-level change, an effect whose significance grows with the system's dimensionality. This stems from a geometric observation: in high dimensions there are more ways to be more different, than ways to be more similar. We focus on ecosystem-level predictions generated from the combination of predictions at the species level. In this setting, the ecosystem's relevant dimensionality is a measure of its diversity (and not simply the number of species). We explain why dimensional effects do not play out when predicting change of a single linear aggregate property (e.g. total biomass), yet are revealed when predicting change of nonlinear properties (e.g. absolute biomass change, stability or diversity), and when several properties are considered at once to describe the ecosystem, as in multi-functional ecology. As an application we discuss the consequences of our theory for multiple-stressor research. This empirical field focuses on interactions between stressors, defined as the error made by a prediction based on their observed individual effects. Our geometric approach can be visualised and explored with a web application (), and we provide pseudocode outlining how our theory can be applied. Our findings highlight and describe the counter-intuitive effects of scaling up uncertain predictions, effects that can occur in any field of science where a reductionist approach is used to generate predictions.","[Orr, James A.; Piggott, Jeremy J.; Jackson, Andrew L.; Arnoldi, Jean-Francois] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Zool Dept, Dublin, Ireland; [Arnoldi, Jean-Francois] CNRS Moulis, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, Moulis, France","Orr, JA (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Zool Dept, Dublin, Ireland.",jaorr@tcd.ie,"Orr, James/AAW-6576-2020; Jackson, Andrew/D-3441-2009","Orr, James/0000-0002-6531-5623; Jackson, Andrew/0000-0001-7334-0434","Irish Research Council Laureate AwardIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology [IRCLA/2017/186, IRCLA/2017/112]; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41]; IReL; TCD Provost's PhD Award","We thank Matthieu Barbier, Nuria Galiana and Yuval Zelnik for discussions and review of previous versions of this work.

Megacities, due to their spatial extent, multicultural demographic structure and multifunctional land-uses, demand new sophisticated scientific approaches to meet the challenges posed by these socio-ecological complexities. Scientists studying megacities are always confronted with the challenge of stratifying their sampling sites for in-depth field investigations particularly in developing countries where the urban landscapes do not expand in line with any predetermined plans - nevertheless with paradigmatic phenomena. This challenge becomes more complicated when considering socio-ecological studies because of the complexity of coupled human-environmental systems where multifunctional composites of land-uses and respective land cover interplay. This paper presents a conceptual framework for developing an urban gradient model, adapted from a set of scientific postulates to systematically hypothesize the selection of research/sampling sites in the field in large urban agglomerations. This framework, due to its scientific legitimacy, is named the Theorized Urban Gradient (TUG). It is based on the assumption that it would allow examination of field/data samples from a variety of urban structures incorporating different functional characteristics. An application of the framework is presented for the megacity of Karachi, Pakistan, comparing the TUG with other standard sampling methods to test and to show the value and the advantages of it. A systematic selection of samples in a compact and informally growing urban landscape is justified. Results corroborate urban gradient, being supported by deductive scientific postulates, as an important research method rather than merely a modelling approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This Resource Criterion defines the main properties of resources, describes the mechanisms that link them to individual species, and gives a particular emphasis to the biosemiotic approach that allows resources to be identified inside a heterogeneous ecological medium adopting the eco-field model. In particular, this Criterion allows to couple matter, structured energy and information composing the ecological systems to the biosemiotic and cognitive mechanisms adopted by individual species to track resources, transforming neutral surroundings into meaningful species-specific Umwelten. The expansion of the human semiotic niche that is a relevant evolutionary process of the present time, assigns the role of powerful and efficient agency to the Resources Criterion to evaluate the effect of human intrusion into the natural systems with habits of key stone species, under the challenge of a growing use of alloctonous, immaterial and symbolic resources of the actual globalized societal models. The Resource Criterion interprets the ecological dynamics contributing to complete the epistemology of the ecology, to open a bridge toward economy and other societal sciences, and to contribute to formulate a General Theory of Resources.","Univ Urbino, Dept Basic Sci & Fundamentals, I-61029 Urbino, Italy","Farina, A (corresponding author), Univ Urbino, Dept Basic Sci & Fundamentals, I-61029 Urbino, Italy.",almo.farina@uniurb.it,,,,,,81,22,22,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1875-1342,1875-1350,,BIOSEMIOTICS-NETH,Biosemiotics,APR,2012,5,1,,,,,17,32,,,,16,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; History & Philosophy Of Science",Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; History & Philosophy of Science,962QV,,,,,9/23/21,,,

However, it is unclear whether there are strong patterns in terms of their major effects, how the vulnerability of different ecosystems varies and which ecosystem services are at greatest risk. We present a global meta-analysis of 199 articles reporting 1041 field studies that in total describe the impacts of 135 alien plant taxa on resident species, communities and ecosystems. Across studies, alien plants had a significant effect in 11 of 24 different types of impact assessed. The magnitude and direction of the impact varied both within and between different types of impact. On average, abundance and diversity of the resident species decreased in invaded sites, whereas primary production and several ecosystem processes were enhanced. While alien N-fixing species had greater impacts on N-cycling variables, they did not consistently affect other impact types. The magnitude of the impacts was not significantly different between island and mainland ecosystems. Overall, alien species impacts are heterogeneous and not unidirectional even within particular impact types. Our analysis also reveals that by the time changes in nutrient cycling are detected, major impacts on plant species and communities are likely to have already occurred.","[Vila, Montserrat; Espinar, Jose L.] CSIC, EBD, E-41092 Seville, Spain; [Hejda, Martin; Jarosik, Vojtech; Pergl, Jan; Pysek, Petr] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Hulme, Philip E.] Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Canterbury, New Zealand; [Jarosik, Vojtech] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, CZ-12801 Prague, Czech Republic; [Maron, John L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Pergl, Jan] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Schaffner, Urs; Sun, Yan] CABI Europe Switzerland, CH-2800 Delemont, Switzerland","Vila, M (corresponding author), CSIC, EBD, Avda Americo Vespucio S-N, E-41092 Seville, Spain.",montse.vila@ebd.csic.es,"Hejda, Martin/H-1589-2014; Schaffner, Urs/A-2783-2012; Vila, Montserrat/D-9339-2013; Pysek, Petr/B-1957-2012; Espinar, Jose L./AAB-5623-2020; Pergl, Jan/H-1071-2011; Hulme, Philip/F-7454-2011","Vila, Montserrat/0000-0003-3171-8261; Espinar, Jose L./0000-0001-6650-1690; Pergl, Jan/0000-0002-0045-1974; Hulme, Philip/0000-0001-5712-0474; Sun, Yan/0000-0002-6439-266X","EUEuropean Commission [KBBE-212459, 244090-STEP-CP-FP]; Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government [CGL2009-7515, CSD2008-00040]; Junta de AndaluciaJunta de Andalucia [RNM-4031]; Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [206/09/0563]; Academy of Sciences of the Czech RepublicCzech Academy of Sciences [AV0Z60050516, MSM0021620828]; Ministry of Environment of the Czech Republic [LC06073]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission; AS CRCzech Academy of Sciences; SCIEX","Discussions with J.M.

In this study, we conducted field surveys, compiled census and remote sensing data, and performed spatial analyses to investigate the interrelationship between greening percentages, plant diversity, and the socioeconomic variables of different primary and secondary UFUs in the cities of Beijing, Zhanjiang, and Haikou in China. We found that these relationships did not differ significantly between primary and secondary UFUs, and that Parks represented the largest areas of forested land, grassland, and water bodies across all three cities. Moreover, the greening percentages of all UFUs across these three cities were positively correlated with both socioeconomic variables and plant species richness.

We argue that the benefits from reducing pollution should be much more broadly defined to include at least three other sources of benefits. First, we develop a game-theoretic model in which firms may under-invest in cost-saving green technologies'. Second, we demonstrate that consideration of future damages and abatement costs leads to a lower current optimal pollution level than that obtained in traditional models. Finally, we show that ecological complexity creates indirect pathways by which greater pollution increases the likelihood of generating irreversible environmental damage. This broader definition of the benefits of pollution abatement yields an optimal level of pollution that may actually be less than the level at which conventionally-measured marginal damages are equal to marginal abatement costs. Thus, environmental policy should be stricter. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although direct transactions are measurable in the field, indirect transactions have been demonstrated to have dominant effects. Integral network utility (U) is a summation of all direct and indirect net transactions in a network presented in matrix format and developed as a feature of Network Environ Analysis (NEA). While U can provide qualitative information about ecological interactions between compartments, the nonzero-sum nature of indirect net transactions has made ecological interpretation of quantitative network utility challenging. Here we aimed to examine U for nine 2- or 3-compartment ecosystem models from a throughflow perspective. For each model, we assigned inputs, outputs, and flows algebraically using flow components traceable across the model, developed corresponding flow (F) and throughflow (T) matrices based on these values, and used symbolic Matlab to calculate the net adjacent flow intensity matrix (D) and U. Substituting algebraic combinations of flow components with corresponding throughflow values allowed us to reduce elements of U to through-flows to the maximum extent possible. Models with only simple input environs were fully throughflow reducible, while models with more complex input environs exhibited one to three nonreducible elements in U. Throughflow reducibility was sufficient, but not necessary, for topological determination of ecological relations of a model, as described by sign(U). Parametrically determined elements of sign(U), along with the specific flow components influencing the sign of that element, could be readily identified based on quantitative consideration of nonreducible flow components. We provide an example showing that considering throughflow as a centrality measure can allow the identification of a quantitative basis for network synergism.

Regardless of their nature, several forms of interactions are discovered to exhibit oscillatory behaviour. This large-amplitude oscillation also de-stabilizes populations of multiple species and raises species' chances of extinction. A central question in ecology is how do we maintain community stability and species coexistence mechanisms in a multiple interactions type community. It is thought that the dynamics of mutualism support multi-species coexistence in a complex ecological system. Here, we extend a four-species multiple interactions type (e.g., resource-competitor-exploiter-mutualist) system by incorporating a local dispersal component. We then employ this model to assess how the combined impacts of dispersal, mutualism and competition shape species coexistence and community stability in this ecological system. Our findings show that the interplay of mutualism and competition affects the complexity of ecological dynamics in this multiple interactions type system with local dispersal. Using numerical simulation, we demonstrate how strong mutualism could stabilize the spatio-temporal dynamics. Employing bifurcation analysis, we also discover that mutualism essentially modifies this ecological community's response to increasing competitive pressure on the resource species. These insights are evident in our findings through the emergence of intriguing dynamics where stable limit cycles alternate with unstable ones as competitive pressure varies. While alternative stable states are common in different ecological systems with mutualistic interactions, they are often stable, whereas, in our studies, we realize that there can be alternative stable or unstable states if the spatial dimension is considered through the incorporation of the diffusion component. Consequently, the long-term dynamics converge to multi-species coexistence outcomes either via a stable steady state or a limit cycle depending on species' initial abundances. It is also observed that this complexity ceases when mutualism becomes strong enough. Additionally, the destabilization of species biodiversity phenomenon through the occurrence of limit cycles increasing in the amplitude of oscillations (with some species population densities approaching zero) is weakened in the presence of strong mutualistic strength and local dispersal. Overall, the joint effects of mutualism, competition and local dispersal result in different community compositions, and these insights may have significant consequences in conservation management and biological control strategies.","[Aliyu, Murtala Bello; Mohd, Mohd Hafiz] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Aliyu, Murtala Bello] Nigerian Army Univ Biu, Dept Math, PMB 1500, Biu, Borno State, Nigeria","Aliyu, MB (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",murtalabelloaliyu@gmail.com,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS)Universiti Sains Malaysia [203/PMATHS/6711645]; Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND),This research is supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) No. 203/PMATHS/6711645.

More recently, biological dispersal is modelled using spatial networks, static sets of georeferenced habitat patches that connect based on a species' maximum dispersal distance. However, dispersal is complex, where spatial patterns at the landscape scale emerge from interactions between ecological entities and landscape features at much finer individual scales. Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a computational representation of complex systems capable of capturing this complexity. Therefore, this study develops a network-ABM (N-ABM) that combines network and complex systems theory to simulate complex evolving spatial networks. The developed N-ABM approach is implemented on the case study of the emerald ash borer (EAB) bark beetle using geospatial datasets in Ontario, Canada. The N-ABM generates dynamic spatial network structures that emerge from interactions between the EAB and tree agents at the individual scale. The resulting networks are analyzed using graph theory measures. Analysis of the results indicates a relationship between preferential attachment in insect host selection and the emergent scale-free network structure. The N-ABM approach can be used to represent dynamic ecological networks and provides insight into how network structure emerges from EAB dispersal dynamics, useful for forest management.","[Anderson, Taylor M.; Dragicevic, Suzana] Simon Fraser Univ, Spatial Anal & Modeling Res Lab, Dept Geog, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Anderson, TM (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Spatial Anal & Modeling Res Lab, Dept Geog, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",taylora@sfu.ca; suzanad@sfu.ca,"Dragicevic, Suzana/D-7333-2017","Dragicevic, Suzana/0000-0003-4144-7530",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Canadian Graduate Scholarship-Doctoral (CGS D),"This study was fully funded by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Canadian Graduate Scholarship-Doctoral (CGS D) and the Discovery Grant awarded to the first and second author respectively.

There is an atmosphere of increasing expectations for conservation efforts associated with a variety of issues from water quality to endangered species. We argue that many current issues are complex by their nature, which influences how we approach them. We define a complex problem as one that varies in time and space. In other words, one answer may not be correct for all sites or during all years. For simple problems a generalized answer may be sufficient, and even for complex problems, general rules provide a good starting point. However, we suggest that it is important to distinguish between simple and complex problems. Several key obstacles emerge when considering complex natural resource problems, namely, 1) no single entity can handle all aspects of the problem and 2) significant knowledge gaps exist and will continue to exist into the future. We suggest that overcoming these obstacles will benefit from 1) a framework for effective partnerships and 2) a mechanism for continuous learning. Managing complex problems will require some combination of the following: 1) a process-based understanding of the problem (i.e., what causes variation in time and space), 2) adaptive management, and 3) effective coordination of research and management. There are many examples of organizations applying portions of these approaches to complex problems; however, it seems that ill many cases the process has simply evolved in that direction rather than being a planned strategy. We suggest that as a profession we need to have a discussion about the nature of the problems we are addressing and how researchers and managers can jointly address these problems.","[Boyd, Chad S.; Svejcar, Tony J.] USDA ARS, Eastern Oregon Agr Res Ctr, Burns, OR 97720 USA","Boyd, CS (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Eastern Oregon Agr Res Ctr, 67826-A,Hwy 205, Burns, OR 97720 USA.",chad.boyd@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,49,59,60,1,34,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,LAKEWOOD,"445 UNION BLVD, STE 230, LAKEWOOD, CO 80228-1259 USA",1550-7424,1551-5028,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

Recent advances in Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) provide new opportunities to simultaneously measure vegetation structure and terrain morphology at fine spatial scales. However, there is limited research on whether ALS metrics correlate with biodiversity measures. Here we used vascular plant data from 283 quarter-hectare (50 m x 50 m) plots from the boreal forest in northeast Alberta, Canada, to evaluate the potential for ALS-derived metrics to explain species richness patterns for vascular plants, as well as for four growth forms: herbaceous (including forbs and graminoids) and woody plants. We found canopy height from ALS was the most consistent and important (positive) factor related to local patterns in vascular plant species richness. Multivariate regression models of ALS-derived metrics explained 20-35% of the variation in species richness among vascular plants and the four subclasses. When considering the current distribution of in situ oil sands leases in the region, vascular plant richness inside of the leases is higher than outside. Areas delineated for woodland caribou conservation had lower average plant richness suggesting that it will do little to protect hotspots of vascular plant diversity in Alberta's boreal forest. Our results highlight the value of using fine-scale measures of ALS-derived vegetation structure to explain, predict, and potentially monitor local plant diversity for a high latitude forested ecosystem.","[Mao, Lingfeng; Dennett, Jacqueline; Nielsen, Scott E.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Bater, Christopher W.; White, Barry; Stadt, John J.] Alberta Agr & Forestry, Forest Management Branch, Forestry Div, Edmonton, AB T5K 2M4, Canada; [Tompalski, Piotr; Coops, Nicholas C.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resource Management, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Farr, Dan] Govt Alberta, Environm Monitoring & Sci Div, 10th Floor,9888 Jasper Ave NW, Edmonton, AB T5J 5C6, Canada; [Kohler, Monica] Univ Alberta, Alberta Biodivers Monitoring Inst, CW 405 Biol Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","Mao, LF (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",maolingfeng2008@163.com,"Stadt, John/S-6786-2016; Nielsen, Scott/C-2842-2013; Nielsen, Scott/O-7482-2019; Coops, Nicholas/L-3652-2019","Stadt, John/0000-0003-3398-5646; Nielsen, Scott/0000-0002-9754-0630; Nielsen, Scott/0000-0002-9754-0630; Coops, Nicholas/0000-0002-0151-9037; Tompalski, Piotr/0000-0002-5841-6530","Alberta Agriculture and Forestry; Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute; Alberta Environmental Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting Agency","We would like to thank Alberta Agriculture and Forestry, Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute, and The Environmental Monitoring and Science Division of Alberta Environment and Parks (formerly Alberta Environmental Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting Agency) for research support.

These components are part of a variable interaction structure in a spatially heterogeneous context. The components of ecological interaction networks can give rise to self-organised, and scale-dependent interaction patterns and processes, which are the underlying causes of the overall ecological systems states. The individual-based modelling approach provides a widely applicable simulation framework based on a 'hierarchy theory' view of ecological systems. Here, we summarise and generalise the theoretical implications of the modelling studies presented in this volume in the field of terrestrial and aquatic, animal and plant ecology. The case studies cover a representative profile of processes related to ecological applications, such as food web interactions, population dynamics, dispersal, energy physiology, nutrient allocation and mutual impact of morphological and physiological development. The generic approach applied in this context allows a hierarchical representation of ecological systems and their components. Model results are obtained as self-organised structural relation networks and as aggregated quantitative states. In order to address different model characteristics we distinguish collective and emergent properties. Collective properties are those that are attributed equally to different organisation levels of the system. Emergent properties result from the activities of lower level entities on a higher organisation level, while not being present on the lower level. They can be subdivided into aggregational and connective properties. Emergent properties that are aggregational are those which emerge as a result of an aggregation procedure by an observer on the higher level which does not make sense or is not applicable on lower levels. Emergent properties that are connective, however, are based on an interaction network of lower level entities, which brings about the specific system characteristic. This classification of model results will allow to generalise the achievements and potential of the individual-based modelling approach in ecology. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The most used statistical modeling techniques can hardly accommodate the complexity of ecological patterns and processes. Finding hidden relationships in complex data is now possible using massive computational power, particularly by means of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods. Here we explored the potential of symbolic regression (SR), commonly used in other areas, in the field of ecology. Symbolic regression searches for both the formal structure of equations and the fitting parameters simultaneously, hence providing the required flexibility to characterize complex ecological systems. Although the method here presented is automated, it is part of a collaborative human-machine effort and we demonstrate ways to do it. First, we test the robustness of SR to extreme levels of noise when searching for the species-area relationship. Second, we demonstrate how SR can model species richness and spatial distributions. Third, we illustrate how SR can be used to find general models in ecology, namely new formulas for species richness estimators and the general dynamic model of oceanic island biogeography. We propose that evolving free-form equations purely from data, often without prior human inference or hypotheses, may represent a very powerful tool for ecologists and biogeographers to become aware of hidden relationships and suggest general theoretical models and principles.","[Cardoso, Pedro; Branco, Vasco V.; Carvalho, Jose C.; Mammola, Stefano] Univ Helsinki, Lab Integrat Biodiveraty Res LIBRe, Finnish Museum Nat Hist Luomus, Helsinki, Finland; [Cardoso, Pedro; Borges, Paulo A., V; Carvalho, Jose C.; Rigal, Francois; Gabriel, Rosalina] Univ Acores, Dept Ciencias Agr, cE3c Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes, Azorean Biodivers Grp, Angra Do Heroismo, Portugal; [Branco, Vasco V.; Correia, Luis] Univ Lisbon, Lab Sistemas Informat Grande Escala, Fac Ciencias, Lisbon, Portugal; [Carvalho, Jose C.] Univ Minho, Mol & Environm Ctr, Dept Biol, Ctr Mol & Environm Biol, Braga, Portugal; [Rigal, Francois] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, Inst Sci Analyt & Phys Chim Environm & Mat UMR524, Com Natl Rech Sci, E2S UPPA, Pau, France; [Mammola, Stefano] CNR, Water Res Inst, Mol Ecol Grp MEG, Verbania, Italy; [Cascalho, Jose] Nucleo Invest & Desenvolvimento Saude NIDes, Dept Ciencias Agr, Angra Do Heroismo, Portugal","Cardoso, P (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Lab Integrat Biodiveraty Res LIBRe, Finnish Museum Nat Hist Luomus, Helsinki, Finland.; Cardoso, P (corresponding author), Univ Acores, Dept Ciencias Agr, cE3c Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes, Azorean Biodivers Grp, Angra Do Heroismo, Portugal.",pedro.cardoso@helsinki.fi,"Mammola, Stefano/I-1518-2019; Cardoso, Pedro/A-8820-2008; Veiga Branco, Vasco/B-7996-2019; Correia, Luis/M-3656-2013; Cascalho, Jose/V-2744-2017; Borges, Paulo/B-2780-2008","Mammola, Stefano/0000-0002-4471-9055; Cardoso, Pedro/0000-0001-8119-9960; Veiga Branco, Vasco/0000-0001-7797-3183; Correia, Luis/0000-0003-2439-1168; Cascalho, Jose/0000-0002-5176-4882; Borges, Paulo/0000-0002-8448-7623",Kone Foundation; FCT through LASIGE Research Unit [UIDP/00408/2020]; European Commission through Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) individual fellowships [882221];  [FCT-PTDC/BIABIC/119255/2010],"PC and VB were supported by Kone Foundation.

Such uncertainty hampers prudent decision making about where and when to invest most intensively in species conservation programmes. Demystifying ecosystem responses to biodiversity alterations may he best achieved through the study of the interactions allowing biotic communities to compensate internally for population changes in terms of contributing to ecosystem function, or their intrinsic functional redundancy. Because individual organisms are the biologically discrete working components of ecosystems and because environmental changes are perceived at the scale of the individual, a mechanistic understanding of functional redundancy will hinge upon understanding how individuals' behaviours influence population dynamics in the complex community setting. Here, I use analytical and graphical modelling to construct a conceptual framework for predicting the conditions under which varying degrees of interspecific functional redundancy can be found in dynamic ecosystems. The framework is founded on principles related to food web successional theory, which provides some evolutionary insights for mechanistically linking functional roles of discrete, interacting organisms with the dynamics of ecosystems because energy is the currency both for ecological fitness and for food web commerce. Net productivity is considered the most contextually relevant ecosystem process variable because of its socioeconomic significance and because it ultimately subsumes all biological processes and interactions. Redundancy relative to productivity is suggested to manifest most directly as compensatory niche shifts among adaptive foragers in exploitation ecosystems, facilitating coexistence and enhancing ecosystem recovery after disturbances which alter species' relative abundances, such as extinctions. The framework further explicates how resource scarcity and environmental stochasticity ma!: constitute 'ecosystem legacies' influencing the emergence of redundancy by shaping the background conditions for foraging behaviour evolution and, consequently, the prevalence of compensator!: interactions. Because it generates experimentally testable predictions for a priori hypothesis testing about when and where varying degrees of functional redundancy ale likely to be found in food webs, the framework may be useful for advancing toward the reliable knowledge of biodiversity and ecosystem function relations necessary for prudent prioritization of conservation programmes. The theory presented here introduces explanation of how increasing diversity can have a negative influence on ecosystem sustainability by altering the environment for biotic inter actions and thereby changing functional compensability among biota - under particular conditions.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Johnson, KH (corresponding author), Univ Toledo, Dept Biol, Toledo, OH 43606 USA.",khjohnson@netscape.net,,,,,,149,31,31,1,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1464-7931,1469-185X,,BIOL REV,Biol.

However, uncertainty, spatial variability and complexity, can hamper the use of such models for decision making in parasite management programs. Methods: We have adapted a Bayesian melding framework for calibrating simulation models to address the need for robust modelling tools that can effectively support management of lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination in diverse endemic settings. We applied this methodology to LF infection and vector biting data from sites across the major LF endemic regions in order to quantify model parameters, and generate reliable predictions of infection dynamics along with credible intervals for modelled output variables. We used the locally calibrated models to estimate breakpoint values for various indicators of parasite transmission, and simulate timelines to parasite extinction as a function of local variations in infection dynamics and breakpoints, and effects of various currently applied and proposed LF intervention strategies. Results: We demonstrate that as a result of parameter constraining by local data, breakpoint values for all the major indicators of LF transmission varied significantly between the sites investigated. Intervention simulations using the fitted models showed that as a result of heterogeneity in local transmission and extinction dynamics, timelines to parasite elimination in response to the current Mass Drug Administration (MDA) and various proposed MDA with vector control strategies also varied significantly between the study sites. Including vector control, however, markedly reduced the duration of interventions required to achieve elimination as well as decreased the risk of recrudescence following stopping of MDA. Conclusions: We have demonstrated how a Bayesian data-model assimilation framework can enhance the use of transmission models for supporting reliable decision making in the management of LF elimination. Extending this framework for delivering predictions in settings either lacking or with only sparse data to inform the modelling process, however, will require development of procedures to estimate and use spatio-temporal variations in model parameters and inputs directly, and forms the next stage of the work reported here.","[Singh, Brajendra K.; Michael, Edwin] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Singh, BK (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",bsingh1@nd.edu,"Singh, Brajendra Kumar/C-3787-2012","Singh, Brajendra Kumar/0000-0001-5847-8750","NTD Modelling Consortium by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Office of the Vice President for Research (OVPR), Notre Dame; Eck Institute for Global Heath, Notre Dame","BKS and EM gratefully acknowledge funding of the NTD Modelling Consortium by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in partnership with the Task Force for Global Health.

Project schedule, as one of the major concerns in construction projects, is always affected by high uncertainties and risks brought by the substantial amount of human and nonhuman factors. Therefore, more prominence should be given to proposing effective measures to minimize the losses caused by schedule risks. Although a certain progress has been made from the previous studies, the lack of dynamics and uncertainty analysis lead to results different from reality. This study aims to propose a novel model for analyzing construction project schedule risk. On the basis of complex systems theory, this paper builds a system dynamics model, and encapsulates the system dynamics model into discrete event simulation to form work module which can be combined according to the requirements of different projects, Monte Carlo simulation is also employed to analyze the uncertainty of risks. In addition, a WeChat platform is established for collecting schedule risk data. Finally, the present model is validated by a case study after the structure test and behaviors test. The results showcase that: (1) System dynamics can effectively deal with the complex problems of project schedule from the perspective of system, which includes rework, quality problems, the allocation of resource, productivity, decision-making delays, schedule pressure, etc. (2) It greatly improves the applicability of the model to combine system dynamics and discrete event simulation together. 3() Monte Carlo simulation enables the model to obtain the distribution of real-time planned duration in the process of construction, and to be suitable for managers with different risk attitudes and risk- bearing capacity to make decisions.","[Xu, Xiaoxiao; Wang, Jiayuan; Huang, Wenke; Wu, Huanyu; Li, Yaning] Shenzhen Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Wang, JY (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",wangjy08@qq.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71272088],We thank National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71272088) for their financial support of this research.,,15,0,0,1,16,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-981-10-0855-9; 978-981-10-0854-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,959,968,,,,10,Business; Construction & Building Technology,Business & Economics; Construction & Building Technology,BI0YL,,,,,9/23/21,,,

It's a project-based learning program in which students investigated and discussed What is complex systems? and develop MAS. In general, it is difficult for students who haven't gained the any special knowledge of computing to build MAS.

We propose a framework to investigate the underlying mechanisms of wireless network functions. This framework isolates and analyses a network function as a complex system. We propose functional topologies to visualize and systematically study the relationships between system entities. We also define a complexity metric C-F (functional complexity), which quantifies the variety of structural patterns and roles of nodes in the topology. This complexity metric provides a wholly new approach to study the operation of telecommunication networks. We study the relationship between C-F and graph structures by analysing graph theory metrics in order to recognize complex organizations. C-F is equal to zero for both a full mesh topology and a disconnected topology. We show that complexity is high for a structure with shorter average path length and higher average clustering coefficient. We make a connection between functional complexity, robustness and response to changes that may appear in the system configuration. We also make a connection between the implementation and the outcome of a network function, which correlates the characteristics of the outcome with the complex relationships that underpin the functional structure.","[Dzaferagic, Merim; Kaminski, Nicholas; McBride, Neal; Macaluso, Irene; Marchetti, Nicola] Trinity Coll Dublin, CONNECT, Res Ctr, Dublin 2, Ireland","Dzaferagic, M (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, CONNECT, Res Ctr, Dublin 2, Ireland.",dzaferam@tcd.ie,"McBride, Neal/K-3854-2017","McBride, Neal/0000-0002-6509-5771",Science Foundation IrelandScience Foundation IrelandEuropean Commission [13/RC/2077],This work was supported by the Science Foundation Ireland under (13/RC/2077).,,32,6,6,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2051-1310,2051-1329,,J COMPLEX NETW,J.

In this paper, we study a scenario that two manufacturers delegate a retailer to sell two substitute brand-products through traditional selling channel and probabilistic products through probabilistic selling channel; the customer has risk aversion behavior for probabilistic product. A noncooperative dynamic price Stackelberg game model is developed based on limited rational expectation. The influences of parameters on the system stability are further analyzed; the phenomenon of flip bifurcation, chaos, and other complex phenomena are reported using bifurcation, attractor and power spectrum etc. The results show that the system stability could be robust with increase in customer's risk aversion and the probability of each product becoming to probability product, and frail with increase in price discount. The manufacturer may benefit from a larger proportion of its product becoming to probabilistic product. When the chaos occurs, the market becomes abnormal, irregular and unpredictable; the two manufacturers should determine their price adjustment speed according to the parameters' values, to ensure the up and downstream enterprises keep stable. The nonlinear feedback control method is used to control the system's chaos. The derived results have very important theoretical and practical values for the two manufacturers and the common retailer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The role of the modeler then lies in posing the questions and choosing the best procedure to answer them, while the role of the model lies in answering the questions, via algorithmic, thus logically simple, procedures. Within this frame-work, complexity is broadly related to the number of question-answer levels involved in the process and the nature of the questions posed. Addressing this complexity depends crucially on the ingenuity and creativity of the modeler This may lead to a view of complexity, which is no more observer-independent, but rather accounts for both historical and cultural development, that is the context of the problem at hand.

Thus, the basic purpose of this research is to solve the major and urgent problems regarding the regional complex system in order to advance the research on SECS. Based on the theory of complex systems, this paper mainly studies the coordinated regional development between sports and economy and constructs a model for simulation and verification. Specifically, the authors examine the relationship between sports development and regional economic growth, modeling the coordination of SECS in the course of development, and setting up an evaluation index system (EIS) for the coordinated development of SECS.

Additionally, the eco-security threshold of Chongming was determined through the approach of system dynamics simulation. The assessment results show that in recent years the comprehensive score of eco-security has been on a gradual rise. With respect to the second-grade indices, the ecological risk and ecological protection indices are still relatively low. Therefore, in order to reduce the ecological risk, ecological construction needs to be strengthened and management measures need to be improved.

It notes that during the past 25 years multistakeholder conflicts, complexity and uncertainty have emerged and persisted as important issues requiring managerial responses. These issues reflect substantial paradigmatic shifts in pursuing and understanding sustainability. Governance directs attention to broad participatory approaches, and complex systems theory emphasises transformative changes and an integrative perspective that couples human and natural systems (a social-ecological system). The paper envisions the prospects of adaptive co-management as an alternative approach to protected areas management for sustainable tourism. It also makes the case for an interdisciplinary approach by highlighting important and informative developments outside tourism studies. Adaptive co-management bridges governance and complex systems by bringing together cooperative and adaptive approaches to management. In appraising the potential for adaptive co-management attention is systematically directed to conceptual, technical, ethical and practical dimensions. While adaptive co-management is clearly not a universal answer, experiences and knowledge from natural resource management raise salient prospects for the approach to be insightfully applied to protected areas for sustainable tourism.","[Plummer, Ryan; Fennell, David A.] Brock Univ, Dept Tourism & Environm, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada","Plummer, R (corresponding author), Brock Univ, Dept Tourism & Environm, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",rplummer@brocku.ca,,,,,,109,129,136,9,92,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

We find that the regional environmental collaborative governance in China shows a growing trend during the period of investigation, but the level is still low. Market segmentation has significantly inhibited the regional collaborative governance of environmental pollution among local governments of China. The effect of market segmentation on the order of personnel input and capital input is significantly negative, while the effect on the order of policy input and organizational input is not significant.

In order for the latter to happen, the role played by technological innovation is crucial. This paper starts by reconsidering Georgescu-Roegen's definition of Promethean Techniques and Tainter's principle of Declining Marginal Returns, with the aim of providing - within the common framework of the theory of complex systems - a sound theoretical basis for the analysis of the rise and fall of complex societies. The main purpose is to verify whether, after the last Promethean revolution, a Great Wave emerged or not. The second part of the paper presents an initial investigation into this hypothesis, using Total Factor Productivity growth as an indicator of (marginal) returns on innovation (1750-2015). Despite the limitations implicit in the use of this indicator, data show three cycles of innovation, corresponding to the first, second and third industrial revolutions, but of different magnitude and duration. In particular, the whole cycle that began with the first industrial revolution in England around 1750, reached a peak in the U.S. in the nineteen-thirties and later declined, following a trend that basically confirms the Great Wave hypothesis. Even recent innovations resulting from the ICT revolution, however considerable, do not seem capable of counteracting this long-term trend. Data on returns on innovation seem, therefore, to be coherent with evidence provided by research in other fields (energy, mineral resources, agriculture, health, education and scientific research), showing that advanced capitalist societies have entered a phase of declining marginal returns - or involuntary degrowth - with possible major effects on the system's capacity to maintain its present institutional framework.

To this end, this paper first proposes a novel conception of smart dispatching for EI with a complex cyber-physical-social system (CPSS) network from the perspective of parallel dispatch, called parallel dispatching robot (PDR), and investigates the implementations of PDR based on smart artificial society (SAS) modeling. First, we introduce EI and describe the dispatching issues of EI. Second, we discuss several important concepts supporting the parallel dispatch conception of EI, including knowledge automation (KA), CPSS, and parallel machine learning (PML). On the basis of these, we elaborate the concept of parallel dispatch. Moreover, we construct a large closed-loop feedback control framework of parallel dispatch for EI integrating a CPSS network based on KA and PML. Third, we establish an experimental platform for PDR research based on the proposed parallel dispatch framework. Fourth, we develop the PML-based SAS models of a single PDR in centralized dispatching modes and group PDRs in decentralized dispatching modes to achieve crowd wisdom emergence and performance improvement in current cyber-physical system frameworks of EI. Moreover, we design an external global closed loop for PDR to evaluate its operation stability. Lastly, we conduct a detailed discussion on PDR and offer some prospects for its engineering implementations. The biggest innovation of this paper lies in systematically proposing the smart dispatching concept and framework for complex CPSS-based EI from the perspective of parallel dispatch and thoroughly investigating how to use SAS modeling to implement parallel dispatching and control for EI considering human and social factors, which is a major extension and theoretical improvement to existing single smart wide area robot concept and a preliminary attempt in investigating a shift from Energy 4.0 to Energy 5.0 in China.","[Cheng, Lefeng; Yu, Tao] South China Univ Technol, Sch Elect Power, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Lefeng; Yu, Tao] South China Univ Technol, Guangdong Key Lab Clean Energy Technol, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Cheng, LF (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Elect Power, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Yu, T (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Guangdong Key Lab Clean Energy Technol, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",chenglf_scut@163.com; taoyu1@scut.edu.cn,,"Cheng, Lefeng/0000-0002-7007-7535; Yu, Tao/0000-0002-0143-261X","Science and Technology Project of China Southern Power Grid Company Ltd.

This flexibility is typical of the sterile worker class, yet rare in queens. In the little fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata), queens have been reported to perform only egg laying. We examined behavior of queens ofW. auropunctataafter demographic manipulation. When half of the workers were removed from the colony, queens were observed caring for eggs, larvae and pupae as well as eating outside of the nest, like forager workers. We examined the relationship between these atypical queen behaviors and their juvenile hormone binding protein (JHbp) and vitellogenin (Vg) expression via QRT-PCR method.JHbpandVgexpression decreased when queens were performing worker tasks, resembling the expected expression pattern of typical sterile workers. Flexibility in queen behaviors in the little fire ant may be an important adaptation to changing environments. As a significant invasive species, such adaptation may increase the probability of colony survival during propagation. Our results not only present new insights in behavioral flexibility in social insects, but also increases our understanding of the success of this significant invasive species.","[Ortiz-Alvarado, Yarira] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Rivera-Marchand, Bert] Inter Amer Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Nat Sci & Math, Bayamon, PR USA","Ortiz-Alvarado, Y (corresponding author), Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, San Juan, PR 00936 USA.",y.ortizal@gmail.com,,"Ortiz-Alvarado, Yarira/0000-0002-3087-9293",PR-LSAMP [1026560]; Agustin Stahl fellowships; Inter American University of Puerto Rico,Financial support was provided by PR-LSAMP (grant no. 1026560) and the Agustin Stahl fellowships awarded to YO-A and the Inter American University of Puerto Rico.,,47,3,3,0,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

For explaining effects on an individual's life-history traits (e.g., growth and reproduction), DEBtox is the leading toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) modelling approach. DEBtox is the application of a model based on dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory to toxic effects, but the term is generally used to refer to practical simplified models from this theoretical framework. The DEBtox approach has remained relatively unchanged over the last few decades, but an updated model is urgently needed. The need for revision is triggered by three, relative recent, developments: the broad acceptance of simple TKTD models for survival (GUTS), the development and successful application of reserve-less DEB models for invertebrates (DEBkiss), and the concrete interest in DEBtox from the field of ERA for pesticides in Europe. In this paper, an updated DEBtox model is presented that is based on DEBkiss, follows the TKTD formulation as established for GUTS (i.e., explicitly taking damage into consideration), and includes a starvation module that is essential for time-varying exposure (as some toxicant action mechanisms may induce starvation). The updated model is illustrated with a case study for springtails exposed to chlorpyrifos in food, and may find applications in science as well as in the regulatory arena.","[Jager, Tjalling] DEBtox Res, De Bilt, Netherlands","Jager, T (corresponding author), DEBtox Res, De Bilt, Netherlands.",tjalling@debtox.nl,"Jager, Tjalling/D-8168-2011","Jager, Tjalling/0000-0002-4424-1442",,,,27,9,9,5,16,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

The evaluation was carried out in two stages. At the first stage the degree of pollution of the atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere of the regions was estimated on the basis of emission of pollutants into the atmosphere from stationary sources, formation of solid domestic wastes (SDW), and discharge of contaminated wastewater. Based on these three indicators, a pollution index was constructed that estimates aggregate pollution level. At the second stage the authors estimated the loads generated by atmospheric emissions, solid waste, and waste water discharged into the territory of each region, per capita and in relation to the environmental capacity of the economy. This allows us to take into account the area of pollution, anthropogenic pressure, and environmental responsibility of the population, as well as the environmental friendliness of production. On the basis of relative indicators, the index of ecological tension was created. Approbation was carried out by the example of the regions of Russia for 2014. The series of maps were created based on the obtained results. With the help of the methodology, an analysis of the environmental situation was carried out, some regions with a disproportionately high environmental load were identified. The importance of specific indicators to assess the peculiar ecological footprint of each person or the production of the region is underlined.","[Tikunov, V. S.; Chereshnia, O.

In the tropics these parameters have mostly been investigated in trees and some herbs, but rarely in climbers which frequently: (1) show clonal growth leading to a patchy distribution pattern similar to that of understory herbs; and (2) flower in the canopy where they may have access to long-distance dispersal like canopy trees. We thus hypothesize for climbers an intermediate genetic structure between herbs and trees. The study aims at assessing breeding system and spatial extent of clonality and gene dispersal in Haumania danckelmaniana (Marantaceae), a common climber in the tropical rain forests from western Central Africa. In eastern Cameroon, 330 ramets were sampled at three spatial scales and genotyped at seven microsatellite loci. Clonality was moderate (clonal extend: 15-25 m, clonal diversity 0.4-0.65) indicating the importance of recruitment from seeds at this locality. The low inbreeding (FIS) suggested predominant outcrossing. The rate of decay of the relatedness between individuals with distance indicated limited gene dispersal distance (rg = 9-50 m, neighborhood sizes Nb = 23-67) in accordance with narrowly gravity dispersed seeds and restricted pollen transfer distance in densely flowering populations. The marked SGS (Sp = 0.011-0.026) was similar to that reported in tropical trees, but might increase with augmented clonality as in many herbs, especially under more severe disturbance regimes.","[Ley, Alexandra C.] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Systemat & Biodivers, Neuwerk 21, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Ley, Alexandra C.; Hardy, Olivier J.] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Fac Sci, Evolutionary Biol & Ecol, CP160-12,50 Ave F Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium","Ley, AC (corresponding author), Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Systemat & Biodivers, Neuwerk 21, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.; Ley, AC (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Fac Sci, Evolutionary Biol & Ecol, CP160-12,50 Ave F Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",alexandra.ley@botanik.uni-halle.de,,,"Germany Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); Belgian Fund for Scientific Research (F.R.S-FNRS)Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS [MIS 4.519.10, T0163.13]; Belgian Science Policy (Belspo) through project AFRIFORD","We thank the logging company Pallisco for granting access to their concession and K.

We evaluate the performance of every preprocessing/network couple and we also evaluate the performance of their ensemble. We test our approach on both a small dataset and the large IP102 dataset. Our best ensembles reaches the state of the art accuracy on both the smaller dataset (92.43%) and the IP102 dataset (61.93%), approaching the performance of human experts on the smaller one.

This characteristic can help inform general theory about how and why ecosystems transform, particularly if distinctive ecosystem properties are studied over long time scales and compared to those of similar ecosystems elsewhere. Here we review the ways in which long-term, comparative, international research has provided perspectives on iconic features of the Everglades that have, in turn, informed general ecosystem paradigms. Studies in other comparable wetlands from the Caribbean to Australia have shed light on distinctive and puzzling aspects such as the upside-down estuary'' and productivity paradox'' for which the Everglades is known. These studies suggest that coastal wetlands on carbonate (karstic) platforms have: (1) hydrological and biogeochemical properties that reflect hidden'' groundwater sources of water and nutrients, (2) very productive, mat-forming algal communities that present a low-quality food to aquatic consumers that encourages (3) highly diversified feeding strategies within and among populations, and (4) extensive and productive seagrass meadows and mangrove forests that promote strong cultural dependencies associated with the ecosystem services they provide. The contribution of international research to each of these general ecological topics is discussed with a particular goal of encouraging informed decision-making in threatened wetlands across the globe.","[Gaiser, Evelyn E.; Anderson, Elizabeth P.; Collado-Vides, Ligia; Fourqurean, James W.; Heithaus, Michael R.; Jaffe, Rudolf; Oehm, Nicholas J.; Price, Rene M.; Troxler, Tiffany G.] Florida Int Univ, Southeast Environm Res Ctr, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Gaiser, Evelyn E.; Collado-Vides, Ligia; Fourqurean, James W.; Heithaus, Michael R.; Troxler, Tiffany G.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sch Environm Arts & Soc, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Anderson, Elizabeth P.; Price, Rene M.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Sch Environm Arts & Soc, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Castaneda-Moya, Edward; Rivera-Monroy, Victor H.] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Coast & Environm, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Jaffe, Rudolf] Florida Int Univ, Dept Chem, Sch Environm Arts & Soc, Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Lagomasino, David] Univ Space Res Assoc, NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Oehm, Nicholas J.] Florida Int Univ, STEM Transformat Inst, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Chowdhury, Rinku Roy] Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USA","Gaiser, EE (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Southeast Environm Res Ctr, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",gaisere@fiu.edu,"Fourqurean, James/AAY-9611-2020; Gaiser, Evelyn/ABG-2507-2020; Rivera-Monroy, Victor H/G-7329-2011; Lagomasino, David/P-8413-2015; Heithaus, Michael/AAF-9914-2020","Fourqurean, James/0000-0002-0811-8500; Gaiser, Evelyn/0000-0003-2065-4821; Lagomasino, David/0000-0003-4008-5363; Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003; Price, Rene/0000-0003-1050-7270; Oehm, Jr., Nicholas J./0000-0001-9013-6750; Castaneda, Edward/0000-0001-7759-4351","Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research program through U.S. National Science Foundation [DEB-9910514, DBI-0620409, DEB-1237517]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE0745606, OCE526065]; George Barley Chair; National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Water Science of Coupled Aquatic Processes in Ecosystems from Space (WaterSCAPES) University Research Center program [NNX-10AQ13]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [CONACyT-Fondo Institucional: I0002, 24847, Etapa: 001]; NASA-JPL project (LSU Subcontract) [1452878]; Southeast Environmental Research Center at FIU [748]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1237517] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This paper was stimulated by conversations at the 2013 meeting of the International Long-Term Ecological Research Network in Seoul, Korea.

One potential midway to enhance the ecological contribution of monoculture plantations is to introduce native tree species in the plantation understory. We conducted phylogenetically explicit enrichment planting experiments beneath the monocultures of two tree species native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest to assess if the evolutionary distance of each seedling species to the overstory tree explained variations in seedling performance. We planted in the understory of two replicate plantations of species Esenbeckia leiocarpa Engl. (Rutaceae; 38 and 25 years old) and Zeyheria tuberculosa (Vell) (Bignoniaceae; both replicates were 30 years old) six native tree species, ranging in their evolutionary distances to these overstory species. We assessed individual seedling survival and height at 1, 7, and 19 months after planting. We found a weak yet significant, positive correlation between seedling performance (growth and survival) and the phylogenetic distance of the planted seedling to the overstory species, which was driven by the poor performance of conspecifics. Seedlings of the same order and class as the overstory trees showed a significantly lower risk of death compared to conspecifics and to the furthest relative, Cryptocarya aschersoniana. These findings highlight that very close relatives to the overstories should be avoided when planting beneath monoculture plantations, but that knowledge on species-specific requirements is still the most important for a successful planting.","[Schweizer, Daniella] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Dept Environm Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schweizer, Daniella; Brancalion, Pedro H.

We evaluated the effectiveness of livestock grazing and cages to exclude rodents by comparing survival of caged and uncaged transplants under two pasture management treatments (grazed vs. ungrazed). We found that transplant survival was greatest for caged plants in grazed pasture with 50% of plants surviving to the end of the second growing season. Grazing increased the species richness in the plant community and decreased the amount of cover for small mammals. Accordingly, rodent density and vole herbivory in late summer were significantly lower on grazed pasture. Our results indicate that rodent herbivores represent a major threat to the survival and reestablishment of autumn buttercup and livestock grazing and protective caging are effective strategies to reduce rodent populations and vole herbivory.","[Skopec, Michele M.; Sandoval, Tyson] Weber State Univ, Dept Zool, 1415 Edvalson St, Ogden, UT 84408 USA; [Lewinsohn, Jennifer] US Fish & Wildlife, Utah Ecol Serv Field Off, 2369 West Orton Circle, West Valley City, UT 84119 USA; [Wirick, Clint] US Fish & Wildlife, Partners Fish & Wildlife Program Utah, 240 North 600 East, Richfield, UT 84701 USA; [Murray, Sheila] Arboretum Flagstaff, 4001 S Woody Mt Rd, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Pence, Valerie] Cincinnati Zoo & Bot Gardens, Ctr Conservat & Res Endangered Wildlife, 3400 Vine St, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA; [Whitham, Linda] Nature Conservancy, 820 Kane Creek Blvd, Moab, UT 84532 USA","Skopec, MM (corresponding author), Weber State Univ, Dept Zool, 1415 Edvalson St, Ogden, UT 84408 USA.",micheleskopec@weber.edu,,"Skopec, Michele/0000-0002-0107-2765",Nature Conservancy; U.S. Fish and WildlifeUS Fish & Wildlife Service; Weber State University,"We thank J.

Although both types of stands, which are of the same age, developed spontaneously, the alder stands occupied damper sites (with thicker A horizons that survived the fire) than those in the birch forests. We surveyed the migration rates of 44 woodland species, primarily ancient woodland indicators, into both forests and the potential differences in these rates depending on their moisture regime and the community type represented by unburned forests, which were treated as the source of the woodland species pool. Additionally, the role of local depressions with high humidity that were covered by post-fire alder woods in the colonization process, as well as species survivorship and recolonisation, were estimated. Woodland species showed diverse migration paces among the sites; most of them migrated faster on more fertile sites with a higher humidity. Small patches of post-fire alder woods contributed to the recolonisation process since many woodland species in the herb layer survived the fire due to its high humidity, which inhibited the intensity of the forest fire. The recovery of woodland species in post-fire woods is the combined effect of regeneration, which relies on autochthonic propagules, and secondary succession, which is based on allochthonic propagules. Local depressions, which provide refuges for fire-sensitive, dispersal-limited species, contribute to their survivorship and thus to the successive recovery of herbaceous layers after a fire.","[Orczewska, Anna; Prukop, Marcin; Strzelczyk, Adriana] Univ Silesia, Dept Ecol, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, PL-40007 Katowice, Poland","Orczewska, A (corresponding author), Univ Silesia, Dept Ecol, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Ul Bankowa 9, PL-40007 Katowice, Poland.",anna.orczewska@us.edu.pl,,"Orczewska, Anna/0000-0002-7924-9794",,,,45,1,1,0,15,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Stable isotope analysis provides a powerful tool to identify the energy sources which fuel consumers, to understand trophic interactions and to infer consumer trophic position (TP), an important concept that describes the ecological role of consumers in food webs. However, current methods for estimating TP using stable isotopes are limited and do not fulfil the complete potential of the isotopic approach. For instance, researchers typically use point estimates for key parameters including trophic discrimination factors and isotopic baselines, and do not explicitly include variance associated with these parameters when calculating TP. 2. We present TROPHICPOSITION, an R package incorporating a Bayesian model for the calculation of consumer TP at the population level using stable isotopes, with one or two baselines. It combines Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations through JAGS and statistical and graphical analyses using R. We model consumer and baseline observations using relevant statistical distributions, allowing them to be treated as random variables. The calculation of TPa random parameterfor one baseline follows standard equations linking N-15 enrichment per trophic level and the trophic position of the baseline (e.g. a primary producer or primary consumer). In the case of two baselines, a simple mixing model incorporating delta C-13 allows for the differentiation between two distinct sources of nitrogen, thus including heterogeneity derived from alternatives sources of delta N-15. 3. Methods currently implemented in tRophicPosition include loading, plotting and summarizing stable isotope data either from multiple sites and/or communities or a local assemblage; loading trophic discrimination factors from an internal database or generating them; defining and initializing a Bayesian model of TP; sampling posterior parameters; analysing, comparing and plotting posterior estimates of TP and other parameters; and calculating a parametric (non-Bayesian) TP estimate.

In aquatic ecosystems, plant detritus has been considered the predominant form of such subsidies; however, while considered less abundant in many ecosystems, carrion represents subsidies with relatively rapid turnover and highly concentrated nutrient and energy release that can have strong and lasting effects on ecosystems. Carrion subsidies can be both autochthonous or allochthonous, and come in the form of natural senescence or disease-related non-consumptive mortality, phenology-based programed death (e.g., salmon spawning and death), or stochastic and episodic events (e.g., mass fish die-offs). All aquatic ecosystems have some level of non-consumptive mortality that provides a background level of carcasses to aquatic ecosystems, while others have a natural history of carrion resource subsidies (e.g., natural salmon-bearing streams), and some have only recently been exposed to phenology-based carrion subsidies (e.g., anthropogenic salmon introductions around the world). Many aquatic ecosystems experience episodic subsidies in the form of unexpected mass mortalities (e.g., eutrophication-, disease-, or climate-related mass die-offs) or have seasonally dependent pulses, like that of marine or lake snow in the form of zooplankton carcasses. The responses of ecosystems to these different histories and frequencies of carrion subsidies have often been independently investigated, with little effort to compare and bridge research boundaries in the broader context of resource subsidies. In this review, we provide a synthesis of how pulsed carrion nutrient and energy subsidies have widespread and lasting impacts on many aquatic ecosystems. We do this with a synthesis of literature from freshwater and marine ecosystems along three themes of how carrion is produced and decomposes: autochthonous and allochthonous necromass; phenology-based mortality; and stochastic and episodic mass mortality subsidies. Studies of charismatic megafauna carrion (e.g., whales) have described significant impacts in deep ocean systems, but much less is understood for other groups of animals. Quantifying the energy, nutrient, and foodweb effects of carrion is needed for more species and among habitats to more fully understand how ubiquitous forms of necromass contribute to aquatic ecosystem structure and function.","[Benbow, M.

We sought to understand impacts of climate change on current and future potential distributions of Olea europaea sensu lato (host) and Bactrocera oleae (parasite) in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), taking into account potential interspecific interactions. We used ecological niche modeling approaches: For biotic interactions, an initial host model was incorporated into the calibration of the parasite model and an initial parasite model was incorporated into calibration of the host model, as host and parasite populations may respond to the presence of the other species. Absence of olive fruits could reduce the flight ability of the fly parasite, whereas presence of the parasite may make a site less suitable for the olives. The host model was improved by inclusion of the parasite information; the converse was not true for the parasite model. Our results anticipated a significant reduction in the potential distribution of Olea europeae in Africa and Europe under future climate scenarios; in contrast, future climates appear more broadly favorable for the parasite species, which poses new and increasing risks for olive cultivation in the Mediterranean region.","[Ashraf, Uzma; Chaudhry, Muhammad Nawaz] Lahore Sch Econ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Lahore 55000, Pakistan; [Peterson, A.

In this way, it becomes possible to make meaningful comparisons among ecosystems and communities and to predict how plant communities might respond to changes in their environment. Here, we classified common alpine plants which occur in snowpatches (Early and Late snowmelt sites) and in adjacent vegetation (Snow-free sites which melt early in the growing season) using Grime's CSR plant strategy scheme. Alpine plant communities are largely driven by environmental filters associated with a relatively constant gradient of snowmelt timing. Since snow persistence influences the abiotic environment and plant assemblages alike, we hypothesised that these patterns would be reflected in community CSR scores. Weighted community CSR scores were clustered towards the stress-tolerator (S) corner of the triangular CSR space, and Snow-free communities were significantly more stress-tolerant than Early and Late snowmelt communities. This suggests that snowpatch communities are functionally distinct from surrounding vegetation when considering the major axes of plant variation identified by CSR theory. These results lend further support to the importance of the timing of snowmelt as a key filter, influencing how species and plant strategy types distribute themselves across the alpine landscape.

In this scheme the presence of tidal currents determining the advection-diffusion transportation of pollutants is taken into account. Such flows have a significant short-term variability and current vector of flow is reversed 2 times a day. However, the existing regulatory guidance documents contain only methods of calculation of unidirectional steady sea currents. The recommendations for practical implementation of the scheme are given, taking into account peculiarities of geo-morphological parameters and ice events in the coastal zone. Waste water discharge should be performed in deep water with presence of the maximum tidal currents and it should be protected from ice deformation. The problem of determining the background concentration of pollutant is considered and the algorithm of its solution is suggested.

Global climate warming has led to the increased potential for forest insects to invade novel habitats of native hosts within the same landmass. The mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) has recently expanded into higher-latitude forests of the principal host, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), and the susceptibility of trees is greater in these systems compared to forests in the native range. We assessed the contribution of the induced defensive response of hosts to this elevated susceptibility, and whether these discrepancies are the result of coevolution with host populations within the historic native range of the insect. We challenged trees using paired treatments of a beetle-attack simulation and a generic defensive response elicitor ( methyl jasmonate) to mitigate variability in the induced response among trees within and among populations, from within and outside the historic range of the beetle. We then assessed the production of monoterpene chemicals by the trees in response to treatments using gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. The differential induction of monoterpenes in response to simulated beetle attack relative to the generic elicitor was highest in populations with the highest putative historic exposure to MPB. Elevated susceptibility and invasion potential of the beetle in novel systems is the proximate result of reduced defensive capacity, ultimately arising from a lack of coevolution with the beetle in novel systems. In forested systems with climate-driven herbivore-host distributional asymmetry, continued warming will potentially exacerbate the impacts of aggressive insect herbivores as they invade defensively naive host populations.","[Burke, Jordan Lewis; Bohlmann, Joerg; Carroll, Allan L.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Bohlmann, Joerg] Univ British Columbia, Michael Smith Labs, 2185 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Burke, JL (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",jordan.lewis.burke@gmail.com,,,British Columbia Future Forest Ecosystem Science Council; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Strategic Network-TRIA-Net Turning Risk Into Action for the Mountain Pine Beetle Epidemic; University of British Columbia,"Funding for this research was provided by the British Columbia Future Forest Ecosystem Science Council (www.gov.bc.ca/nro), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Strategic Network-TRIA-Net Turning Risk Into Action for the Mountain Pine Beetle Epidemic (tria-net.srv.ualberta.ca/), and the University of British Columbia (www.ubc.ca).

We investigated whether differences in thermoregulatory mechanisms, specifically evaporative cooling, explain the different behavior of three passerine species while stopping over in the Negev desert, Israel. We measured cutaneous water loss (CWL) under ambient conditions and the temperature of panting onset in an experimental setup. In addition, we performed behavioral observations of birds at a stopover site where we manipulated water availability. Blackcaps had slightly higher CWL at relatively low temperatures than Willow Warblers and Lesser Whitethroats. When considered relative to total body mass, however, Willow Warblers had the highest CWL of the three species. Blackcaps started panting at lower ambient temperature than the other two species. Taken together, these results suggest that Willow Warblers are the most efficient in cooling their body, possibly with the cost of needing to regain water by actively foraging during their staging. Lesser Whitethroats had a similar pattern, which was reflected in their slightly higher levels of activity and drinking behavior when water was available. However, in general the behavior of migratory species was not affected by the availability of water, and they were observed drinking rather rarely. Our results indicate that differences in thermoregulatory mechanisms might be at the basis of the evolution of different stopover strategies of migratory birds while crossing arid areas such as deserts.","[Paces, Bernhard; Waringer, Barbara M.] Univ Vienna, Fac Life Sci, Dept Bot & Biodivers Res, Div Trop Ecol & Anim Biodivers, Vienna, Austria; [Domer, Adi; Burns, Darren; Zvik, Yoram; Shochat, Eyal] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Zvik, Yoram] Hoopoe Ornithol & Ecol Ctr, Yeroham, Israel; [Wojciechowski, Michat S.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Biol & Vet Sci, Dept Vertebrate Zool & Ecol, Torun, Poland; [Sapir, Nir] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, Haifa, Israel; [Sapir, Nir] Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, Haifa, Israel; [Maggini, Ivan] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, Vienna, Austria","Maggini, I (corresponding author), Univ Vet Med Vienna, Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, Vienna, Austria.",ivan.maggini@vetmeduni.ac.at,,,University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; The University of Vienna; Needs-based Scholarship (Forderstipendium); Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [702/17]; Polish National Science Centre [2017/25/B/NZ8/00541],"This study was supported by a start-up grant (Profillinien) of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna to IM.

Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in ecology and related fields. They are frequently adopted to predict the expected occurrence (presence/absence) or abundance over large spatial scales, that is, to produce a species distribution map. Two issues that almost universally affect these models are measurement errors (especially imperfect detection) and residual spatial autocorrelation. 2. We explored the effects of imperfect detection and autocorrelation in abundance models by simulating datasets which did or did not contain these two effects and analysing them with four different models that did or did not accommodate them. Specifically, we used a Poisson GLM as a baseline, an N-mixture model accounting only for imperfect detection and two N-mixture models that accounted for imperfect detection, but differed in their specification of spatial autocorrelation (CAR random effects vs. two-dimensional splines). 3. In a case study, we then applied these models to Common Redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus data from the second Swiss Breeding Bird Atlas (1993-1996) and validated them using an independent monitoring dataset. 4. We found that both imperfect detection and autocorrelation strongly affected the quality and the uncertainty of abundance maps, especially when they occurred together. Spatial N-mixture models were well able to estimate the true abundance maps. Explicit modelling of measurement error and spatial autocorrelation can thus greatly improve the quality of SDMs and should not be ignored when producing large-scale abundance or occurrence maps.","[Guelat, Jerome; Kery, Marc] Swiss Ornithol Inst, Sempach, Switzerland","Guelat, J (corresponding author), Swiss Ornithol Inst, Sempach, Switzerland.",jerome.guelat@vogelwarte.ch,,"Guelat, Jerome/0000-0003-1438-4378",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [31003A_146125],"This work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant number 31003A_146125 to M.K. and Michael Schaub).

TL is widely verified. We show here that empirical time series of density of the Hokkaido gray-sided vole, Myodes rufocanus, sampled 1962-1992 at 85 locations, satisfied temporal and spatial forms of TL. The slopes (b +/- standard error) of the temporal and spatial TL were estimated to be 1.613 +/- 0.141 and 1.430 +/- 0.132, respectively. A previously verified autoregressive Gompertz model of the dynamics of these populations generated time series of density which reproduced the form of temporal and spatial TLs, but with slopes that were significantly steeper than the slopes estimated from data. The density-dependent components of the Gompertz model were essential for the temporal TL. Adding to the Gompertz model assumptions that populations with higher mean density have reduced variance of density-independent perturbations and that density-independent perturbations are spatially correlated among populations yielded simulated time series that satisfactorily reproduced the slopes from data. The slopes (b +/- standard error) of the enhanced simulations were 1.619 +/- 0.199 for temporal TL and 1.575 +/- 0.204 for spatial TL.","[Cohen, Joel E.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Populat, 1230 York Ave,Box 20, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Cohen, Joel E.] Columbia Univ, 1230 York Ave,Box 20, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Cohen, Joel E.] Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Cohen, Joel E.] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, 5747 South Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Saitoh, Takashi] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr, North 11,West 10, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600811, Japan","Cohen, JE (corresponding author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Populat, 1230 York Ave,Box 20, New York, NY 10065 USA.; Cohen, JE (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, 1230 York Ave,Box 20, New York, NY 10065 USA.; Cohen, JE (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA.; Cohen, JE (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, 5747 South Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",cohen@rockefeller.edu,"Saitoh, Takashi/D-6021-2012","Saitoh, Takashi/0000-0003-4085-5014","U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-1225529]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26291086] Funding Source: KAKEN; Direct For Mathematical & Physical ScienNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1225529] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",T.

But missing from these models is an explicit understanding of how resource exchange and resource limitation can drive or prevent instability. Here, we show that systems based on general rules for the consumption and exchange of resources are guaranteed to be stable when exchange of resources is reciprocated by each pair of partners. These cooperative, mutualistic interactions can be arbitrarily strong and yet not disrupt stability. More general modes of exchange will lead to instability when supply rates are low, but when resource supply from outside the system is sufficiently high, arbitrary exchange is consistent with a stable equilibrium.","[Butler, Stacey; O'Dwyer, James P.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","O'Dwyer, JP (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",srbutle1@illinois.edu; jodwyer@illinois.edu,,,Simons Foundation [376199]; McDonnell Foundation [220020439]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB1557192],"This study is supported by the Simons Foundation Grant No. 376199, McDonnell Foundation Grant NO. 220020439, NSF No. DEB1557192.",,56,5,5,2,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1874-1738,1874-1746,,THEOR ECOL-NETH,Theor.

We hypothesise that for a given life form like trees, greater harshness leads to a smaller range of traits that are viable and thereby also to lower species diversity. On the basis of a strong dependence of maximum tree height on site productivity and other measures of site quality, we propose maximum tree height as an inverse measure of environmental harshness for trees. Our results show that tree species richness is strongly positively correlated with maximum tree height across multiple spatial scales in forests of both eastern and western North America. Maximum tree height co-varied with species richness along gradients from benign to harsh environmental conditions, which supports the hypothesis that harshness may be a general mechanism limiting local diversity and explaining diversity gradients within a biogeographic region.","[Marks, Christian O.] Nat Conservancys, Northampton, MA 01060 USA; [Muller-Landau, Helene C.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama; [Tilman, David] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Marks, CO (corresponding author), Nat Conservancys, Northampton, MA 01060 USA.",cmarks@tnc.org,"Marks, Christian O./F-7403-2012","Marks, Christian O./0000-0002-8936-4753; Muller-Landau, Helene/0000-0002-3526-9021",University of MinnesotaUniversity of Minnesota System; David and Lucile Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; Fonds Quebecois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les TechnologiesFQRNT,"We thank Joe Wright, two anonymous reviewers and editors Tim Coulson and Richard Bardgett for comments on earlier drafts, and Charles 'Hobie' Perry for help with the FIA data.

To explore the dynamics of growth in migratory bull trout, one of the models, the von Bertalanffy model, was also fitted based on age estimates derived from annuli and growth increments on pelvic fin ray sections for three juvenile outmigration age groups. Among five growth models evaluated, four models fitted to the age-length data described the fish growth for ages 3 to 11 comparably well. Only a model that exhibited positive growth acceleration as age progressed fitted the data less effectively. Growth was significantly (P < 0.001) related to the age of outmigration from natal streams (1-3 years). Migratory bull trout were found to reach maturation at ages 4-6; the common age-4 maturation was younger than most comparable studies. All mature fish studied reared for 2-3 years in downriver or reservoir habitat. As the adult population size has continued to increase since harvest closure in 1994, further research should be directed towards understanding the trade-offs between these increasing numbers of adult fish and growth, survival, migration, and maturation schedules.","[Erhardt, John M.; Scarnecchia, Dennis L.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Erhardt, JM (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",jerhardt@usgs.gov,,,daho Department of Fish and Game,We thank colleagues at the University of Idaho Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources for their efforts which contributed to this study.

The Escarpment forest is one of the most important areas for bird diversity in the country. However, there is almost no information about the territorial needs and habitat preferences of its threatened endemic birds. This study evaluated these needs and preferences in Gabela akalat Sheppardia gabela, a range-restricted endemic to the Central Escarpment. Eighteen individuals of Gabela akalat were captured and radio-tracked with the objectives of establishing their territory size (through home-range size estimates) and habitat preferences using compositional analysis. Home-range sizes were slightly larger than other Sheppardia species and Gabela akalat evidently avoided clearings and preferred forest habitat, although it was also able to use farmland areas and secondary growth to a lesser extent. Conservation measures should focus on the preservation of remaining old-growth forest through the establishment of a nature reserve in Kumbira. To assure the success of such an initiative, the local population should participate in planning, administration and enforcement. We outline some measures that could help address the economic needs of the local community while maintaining forest cover.","[Caceres, Aimy; Melo, Martim] Univ Porto, CIBIO InBIO Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos, Campus Agr Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Caceres, Aimy; Melo, Martim] ISCED Inst Super Ciencias Educ Huila, Rua Sarmento Rodrigues S-N, Lubango 230, Angola; [Melo, Martim; Mills, Michael S.

We use the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List Criteria for ecosystems to assess the risk of ecosystem collapse in Australian alpine snow patch herbfields. These ecosystems occur on both mainland Australia and Tasmania. They are restricted to steep, south-easterly slopes where snow pack persists well into the summer growing season. Consequently, they are rare, and have high conservation significance. We evaluated the risk of snow patch herbfield ecosystem collapse' against criteria that accounted for the ecosystem's restricted distribution, projected decline in the snowpack and increased rates of invasion by taller growing native species of shrub and grass. Our analyses revealed considerable uncertainty in estimates of risk based on some criteria, particularly those related to thresholds of ecosystem collapse caused by biotic change. On the basis of the IUCN Red List criteria, we conclude that the ecosystem is endangered'. This is because of the restricted geographical distribution of the ecosystem, a substantial and highly likely decline in the abundance of snow (the principal abiotic driver of the ecosystem), and the prospect of invasion of much of the ecosystem by taller growing native shrubs and grasses. Our case study demonstrates the utility of the Red List methodology for assessing risks to biodiversity in rare ecosystems where changes to both abiotic factors and the relative dominance of native species constitute major threats. Our findings indicate the importance of snow patch herbfields as refugia for dwarf alpine plant species in the face of climate change, the need for continued monitoring, the removal of feral animals from the Australian Alps and scenario planning.","[Williams, R.

These strategies may lead to increased dietary overlap when competition for resources is strong. To quantify temporal contributions of high (C-3) versus low quality (C-4) resources in diets of silky pocket mice (Perognathus flavus), we used stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) analysis of 1391 plasma samples collected over 2years. Of these, 695 samples were from 170 individuals sampled >= 3 times across seasons or years, allowing us to assess changes in dietary breadth at the population and individual levels across a boom-bust population cycle. In 2014, the P. flavus population increased to 412 captures compared to 8 captures in prior and subsequent years, while populations of co-occurring small mammals remained stable. As intraspecific competition increased, the population-wide dietary niche of P. flavus did not change, but individual specialization increased significantly. During this period, similar to 27% (41/151) of individuals sampled specialized on C-3 resources, which were abundant during the spring and previous fall seasons. Most of the remaining individuals were C-3-C-4 generalists (64%) (96/151), and only 9% (14/151) specialized on C-4 resources. In 2015, P. flavus population density and resource availability declined, individual dietary breadth expanded (84% generalists), no C-3 specialists were found, and specialization on C-4 resources increased (16%). Our results demonstrate a high degree of inter-individual plasticity in P. flavus foraging strategies, which has implications for how this species will respond to environmental change that is predicted to decrease C-3 resources in the future.","[Noble, Jennifer D.; Collins, Scott L.; Hallmark, Alesia J.; Wolf, Blair O.; Newsome, Seth D.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Maldonado, Karin] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Artes Liberales, Dept Ciencias, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Santiago, Chile","Collins, SL (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",scollins@unm.edu,"Collins, Scott L/P-7742-2014; MALDONADO, KARIN/T-1302-2019","Collins, Scott L/0000-0002-0193-2892; Hallmark, Alesia/0000-0002-1024-5779",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank N.

Climate change indirectly affects forest ecosystems through changes in the frequency, size, and/or severity of wildfires. In addition to its direct effects prior to fire, climate also influences immediate postfire recruitment, with consequences for future vegetation structure and fire activity. A major uncertainty, therefore, is if, when and where vegetation shifts will occur. 2. With an emphasis on species traits, we use a demographic framework to examine how the interaction of changing climate and fire will affect postfire woody vegetation recruitment and the likelihood of vegetation shifts. Each demographic stage - adult mortality, propagule availability, seed germination, seedling establishment, and seedling survival - serves as a filter through which a species must pass for establishment and recovery to occur. 3. We apply this framework to case studies in western North American forests, including boreal and southwestern U.S. Pinus ponderosa forests, to help understand the mechanisms behind recent postfire vegetation changes. The case studies highlight how changes in climate and fire properties will make it increasingly difficult for some species to pass through each demographic filter in the future. 4. As climate warming continues, we expect increased dominance of species that resprout following fire, maintain canopy or soil seed banks, have long distance seed dispersal, produce drought-tolerant seedlings, and/or reach reproductive maturity quickly. The persistence of postfire vegetation shifts will depend the on ratio of recovery time to disturbance interval(s). 5. An advantage of the demographic-filter framework is that it places emphasis on mechanisms, thus improving our ability to anticipate future vegetation shifts. As such, it highlights the clear need for more mechanistic studies of postfire recruitment to disentangle the relative effects of multiple drivers in postfire environments.","[Davis, Kimberley T.; Higuera, Philip E.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Sala, Anna] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Davis, KT (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",kimberley.davis@umontana.edu,"Higuera, Philip Edward/B-1330-2010; Davis, Kimberley Taylor/A-4797-2017","Higuera, Philip Edward/0000-0001-5396-9956; Davis, Kimberley Taylor/0000-0001-9727-374X","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS 1461576]; Joint Fire Science Program [15-1-07-30, 16-1-01-15]","National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: BCS 1461576; Joint Fire Science Program, Grant/Award Number: 15-1-07-30 and 16-1-01-15",,174,26,26,1,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Most notably for ecologists, POMDPs have helped solve the trade-offs between investing in management or surveillance and, more recently, to optimise adaptive management problems. Despite an increasing number of applications in ecology and natural resources, POMDPs are still poorly understood. The complexity of the mathematics, the inaccessibility of POMDP solvers developed by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community, and the lack of introductory material are likely reasons for this. We propose to bridge this gap by providing a primer on POMDPs, a typology of case studies drawn from the literature, and a repository of POMDP problems. We explain the steps required to define a POMDP when the state of the system is imperfectly detected (state uncertainty) and when the dynamics of the system are unknown (model uncertainty). We provide input files and solutions to a selected number of problems, reflect on lessons learned applying these models over the last 10 years and discuss future research required on interpretable AI. Partially observable Markov decision processes are powerful decision models that allow users to make decisions under imperfect observations over time. This primer will provide a much-needed entry point to ecologists.","[Chades, Iadine; Nicol, Sam; Ferrer-Mestres, Jonathan] CSIRO, Dutton Pk, Qld, Australia; [Pascal, Luz V.] ENSTA, Palaiseau, France; [Fletcher, Cameron S.] CSIRO, Atherton, Qld, Australia","Chades, I (corresponding author), CSIRO, Dutton Pk, Qld, Australia.",iadine.chades@csiro.au,,,CSIRO Research Office Postdoctoral Fellowship; CSIRO MLAI Future Science Platform; CSIRO Julius Career Award,CSIRO Research Office Postdoctoral Fellowship; CSIRO MLAI Future Science Platform; CSIRO Julius Career Award,,87,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

Among them, Nosema ceranae is an intracellular microsporidian parasite, which plays a major impact on honey bees colonies. However, both efficiency and innocuity of current treatment against N. ceranae are being questioned, thus raising the urgent need to develop alternative prophylactic and curative strategies. Endogenous microbial communities (i.e., host microbiota) are known to play a major role in disease prevention, and more recently both bacterial and yeast strains issued from gut microbiota were observed to improve hosts resistance against intracellular parasites both in mammals and insect models. The use of probiotics in honey bee nutrition is therefore promising to treat or prevent diseases. Therefore, further investigations are needed to properly select microorganisms with probiotic properties. In an in vivo experimental infection by N. ceranae, the probiotic effect of two honeybee gut bacterial strains (Parasacchanbacter apium (PC1 sp.) and Bacillus sp. (PC2 sp.)), and two broad spectra probiotics (Bactocell (R) and Levucell SB (R)) has been measured. Both curative and prophylactic administrations were tested: honey bees infected with N. ceranae and noninfected. For the four probiotic candidates, significant increases of survival probabilities (20-30%) were measured after two weeks of treatment with the administration of 10(3) CFU/mL in sugar syrup, both in curative and prophylactic treatments. The present study shows that endogenous bacterial strains were at least as much efficient and safe than broad spectra probiotics in increasing survival in the context of experimental infection with N. ceranae. Therefore, taking advantage of beneficial host microbiota properties is a promising avenue to develop efficient and sustainable curative strategies against opportunistic diseases in honey bee colonies.","[El Khoury, Sarah; Cheaib, Bachar; Bouslama, Sidki; Mercier, Pierre-Luc; Giovenazzo, Pierre; Derome, Nicolas] Univ Laval, Inst Biol Integrat & Syst, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Rousseau, Andree] Ctr Rech Sci Anim, Prod Apicole, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Lecoeur, Alexandre] Univ Paris Diderot, UFR Sci Vivant, Paris, France; [Demey, Vanessa; Castex, Mathieu] Lallemand SAS, Blagnac, France","Derome, N (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Inst Biol Integrat & Syst, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",nicolas.derome@bio.ulaval.ca,,"Bouslama, Sidki/0000-0001-8715-0420; Rousseau, Andree/0000-0002-2563-4849; Cheaib, Bachar/0000-0002-0325-823X",Agri-Innovation programme from Agriculture and Agri-Food CanadaAgriculture & Agri Food Canada [14-AP-247],This work was funded with the Agri-Innovation programme from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

This expansion poses a great challenge because crop production is an activity that profoundly affects natural habitats and biodiversity. An interesting perspective for biodiversity conservation is the incorporation of production systems into overall conservation efforts. Rice is one of the world's major crops and Brazil is the leader in the Western Hemisphere with 35% of the cultivated area. Rice fields are sometimes considered man-made wetlands with potential values for many aquatic species. The main goal of this paper is to synthesize results of studies carried out over the past decade in rice fields of southern Brazil to identify management practices that enhance biodiversity levels in agricultural matrices. We also provide direction to environmentally-oriented legislators for implementing general strategies for rice farmers to supplement aquatic diversity of natural wetlands. Major techniques include: 1) keeping some rice fields flooded during the fallow phase; 2) increasing organic rice production to reduce the use of pesticides; 3) encouraging rice farmers to rejuvenate soils by periodically taking fields out of production; and 4) avoid draining new wetlands for rice production. Incentivizing good management practices in rice fields would transfer some of the responsibilities related to the conservation of biodiversity to production systems.

The role of these communities in carbon sequestration and the potential role they have in storing water in the desert plant biomass is unknown. The present study sought to quantify the amount of carbon and water stored by Tillandsia latifolia Meyen in a tillandsial lomas of Lima (Piedra Campana, Canete-Lima). To do this, all the slopes and ravines of a tillandsial sector were evaluated; aerial biomass was weighed and soil samples were collected (first 10 cm); the percentage of water and carbon stored in the biomass, and the carbon in the soil samples were measured. All the data obtained were processed using the kriging interpolation technique. Total carbon measured was 94.10 tons (t) (3.63 t/ha) with more carbon stored in the part of the soil (76.50 t) than in the aerial part (17.60 t). The amount of carbon stored by this tillandsial lomas is below that of several ecosystems that are used as compensation of CO2 emissions such as wetlands or Amazonian vegetation. On the other hand, the water stored amounted to 164 thousand liters, a value that is important as a water reserve in this desert region. The implications of the results obtained for the assessment and management of this desert ecosystem are discussed.","[Arevalo, Jefree] Univ Cient Sur, Ingn Ambiental, Fac Ciencias Ambientales, Av Antigua Carretera Panamer Sur Km 19, Lima 42, Peru; [Aponte, Hector] Univ Cient Sur, Biol Marina, Fac Ciencias Vet & Biol, Av Antigua Carretera Panamer Sur,Km 19, Lima 42, Peru; [Aponte, Hector] Univ Nacl Mayor San Marcos, Lab Florist, Dept Dicotiledoneas, Museo Hist Nat, Ave Arenales 1256,Apartado 14-0434, Lima 14, Peru","Arevalo, J (corresponding author), Univ Cient Sur, Ingn Ambiental, Fac Ciencias Ambientales, Av Antigua Carretera Panamer Sur Km 19, Lima 42, Peru.",je-free@hotmail.com; haponte@cientifica.edu.pe,"Aponte, Hector/AAW-6467-2021",,,,,24,1,1,1,1,UNIV NACIONAL AGRARIA LA MOLINA,LIMA,"LA MOLINA, LIMA, 00000, PERU",1726-2216,1993-9507,,ECOL APL,Ecol.

Nevertheless, estimation of biodiversity using ecological field data can be difficult for several reasons. For instance, for very large areas, it is challenging to collect data that provide reliable information. Some of these restrictions in Earth observation can be avoided through the use of remote sensing approaches. Various studies have estimated biodiversity on the basis of the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH). According to this hypothesis, spectral heterogeneity over the different pixel units of a spatial grid reflects a higher niche heterogeneity, allowing more organisms to coexist. Recently, the spectral species concept has been derived, following the consideration that spectral heterogeneity at a landscape scale corresponds to a combination of subspaces sharing a similar spectral signature. With the use of high resolution remote sensing data, on a local scale, these subspaces can be identified as separate spectral entities, the so called spectral species. Our approach extends this concept over wide spatial extents and to a higher level of biological organization. We applied this method to MODIS imagery data across Europe. Obviously, in this case, a spectral species identified by MODIS is not associated to a single plant species in the field but rather to a species assemblage, habitat, or ecosystem. Based on such spectral information, we propose a straightforward method to derive a-(local relative abundance and richness of spectral species) and fl-diversity (turnover of spectral species) maps over wide geographical areas.","[Rocchini, Duccio; Chiarucci, Alessandro] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Via Irnerio 42, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Rocchini, Duccio; Malavasi, Marco; Moudry, Vitezslav; Simova, Petra] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Appl Geoinformat & Spatial Planning, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Salvatori, Nicole] Univ Udine, Dept Agrifood Anim & Environm Sci DI4A, Via Sci 206, I-33100 Udine, UD, Italy; [Salvatori, Nicole] Univ Trieste, Dept Life Sci, Via Giorgieri 5, I-34100 Trieste, TS, Italy; [Beierkuhnlein, Carl] Univ Bayreuth, BayCEER, Biogeog, Univ Str 30, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [de Boissieu, Florian; Feret, Jean-Baptiste] IRSTEA Montpellier, UMR TETIS, 500 Rue JF Breton, F-34093 Montpellier 5, France; [Foerster, Michael; Kleinschmit, Birgit] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Geoinformat Environm Planning, Str 17 Juni 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Garzon-Lopez, Carol X.] Univ los Andes, Ecol & Vegetat Physiol Grp EcoFiv, Cr 1E 18A, Bogota, Colombia; [Gillespie, Thomas W.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hauffe, Heidi C.] Fdn Edmund Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, Dept Biodivers & Mol Ecol, Via E Mach 1, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy; [He, Kate S.] Murray State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Murray, KY 42071 USA; [Lenoir, Jonathan] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, UR Ecol & Dynam Syst Anthropises, EDYSAN, UMR 7058 CNRS UPJV, 1 Rue Louvels, F-80037 Amiens 1, France; [Nagendra, Harini] Azim Premji Univ, PES Inst Technol Campus, Pixel Pk,B Block,Hosur Rd, Bangalore 560100, Karnataka, India; [Payne, Davnah] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, GMBA Off, Altenbergrain 21, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Torresani, Michele] Free Univ Bolzano Bozen, Fac Sci & Technol, Piazza Univ,Univ Pl 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Bozen, Italy; [Wegmann, Martin] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Remote Sensing, Remote Sensing & Biodivers Res Grp, Wurzburg, Germany; [Torresani, Michele] Univ Trento, Dept Civil Environm & Mech Engn, Atmospher Phys Grp, Via Mesiano 77, I-38123 Trento, Italy","Rocchini, D (corresponding author), Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Via Irnerio 42, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",duccio.rocchini@unibo.it,"Chiarucci, Alessandro/D-2622-2009; Feret, Jean-Baptiste/A-8351-2013; Simova, Petra/P-2904-2014","Chiarucci, Alessandro/0000-0003-1160-235X; Moudry, Vitezslav/0000-0002-3194-451X; Feret, Jean-Baptiste/0000-0002-0151-1334; Malavasi, Marco/0000-0002-9639-1784; Simova, Petra/0000-0003-2480-1171","H2020 project SHOWCASE; H2020 COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [CA17134, CA15212]; Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR)European Commission [ANR-17-CE32-0001]; French Space Agency (CNES)Centre National D'etudes Spatiales","DR was partially supported by the H2020 project SHOWCASE and by the H2020 COST Action CA17134 Optical synergies for spatiotemporal sensing of scalable ecophysiological traits (SENSECO).

Thus, evaluating the risk of losing ecosystem services due to wildfires is essential for anticipating and adapting to future conditions. Here, we analyze the spatial patterns of the risk of losing key forest ES and biodiversity (that is, carbon sink, bird richness, hydrological control and erosion control) due to wildfires in Catalonia (NE Spain), taking into account exposed values, hazard magnitude, susceptibility and lack of adaptive capacity. We also determine the effect of climate and different forest functional types on the risk of losing ES under average and extreme hazard conditions (defined as median and 90th percentile values of the Fire Weather Index, respectively), as well as on the increase in risk. Our results show that hazard magnitude is the most important component defining risk under average conditions. Under extreme conditions, exposed values (carbon sink capacity and erosion control) emerged as the most important components of risk. Climate was the main driver of ES at risk under average conditions, but the high vulnerability of non-Mediterranean conifer forests with a low adaptive capacity gained importance under extreme conditions. The increase in risk between average and extreme conditions was driven by precipitation, as the highest increases in risk were found in relatively wet forests with low average risk at present. These results have direct implications on the future risk of losing ES to wildfires in Mediterranean forests but also in other regions, and they could contribute to future policies by anticipating conditions associated with particularly high risk that can be used to guide efficient forest management.","[Lecina-Diaz, Judit; Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi; Alvarez, Albert; Vayreda, Jordi; Retana, Javier] CREAF, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalonia, Spain; [Lecina-Diaz, Judit] InBIO CIBIO Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos, Campus Agrario Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas 7, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi; Retana, Javier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalonia, Spain","Lecina-Diaz, J (corresponding author), CREAF, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalonia, Spain.; Lecina-Diaz, J (corresponding author), InBIO CIBIO Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos, Campus Agrario Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas 7, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal.",j.lecina@creaf.uab.cat,,,"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2015-073854, CGL2014-59742- C2-1-R, CGL2017-89999-C2-1-R]; FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology, I.P., under the FirESmart Project [PCIF/MOG/0083/2017]","We are grateful to Miquel de Caceres for sharing data of the model De Caceres and others (2015).

Functional groups have been commonly used to capture the diversity of forms and functions and thus simplify the reality. However, the explicit incorporation of species interactions is still lacking in functional group-based approaches. Here, we propose a new approach based on an a posteriori clustering of species to quantify the effects of species interactions on ecosystem functioning. We first decompose the observed ecosystem function using null models, in which species diversity does not affect ecosystem function, to separate the effects of species interactions and species composition. This allows the identification of a posteriori functional groups that have contrasting diversity effects on ecosystem functioning. We then develop a formal combinatorial model of species interactions in which an ecosystem is described as a combination of co-occurring functional groups, which we call an assembly motif. Each assembly motif corresponds to a particular biotic environment. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach using datasets from a microbial experiment and the long-term Cedar Creek Biodiversity II experiment. We show that our a posteriori approach is more accurate, more efficient and more parsimonious than a priori approaches. The discrepancy between a priori and a posteriori approaches results from the way each clustering is set up: a priori approaches are based on ecosystem or species properties, such as ecosystem size (number of species or functional groups) or species' functional traits, whereas our a posteriori approach is based only on the observed interaction and composition effects on ecosystem functioning. Our findings demonstrate that an a posteriori approach is highly explanatory: it identifies who interacts with whom, and quantifies the effects of species interactions on ecosystem functioning. They also highlight that a combinatorial modelling of ecosystem functioning can predict the functioning of an ecosystem without any hypothesis about the biotic or environmental determinants or any information on species functional traits. It only requires the species composition of the ecosystem and the observed functioning of others that share the same assembly motif.","[Jaillard, Benoit; Richon, Camille] INRA, Ecol Fonct & Biogeochim Sols & Agrosyst Eco & Sol, Montpellier, France; [Deleporte, Philippe] CIRAD, Ecol Fonct & Biogeochim Sols & Agrosyst Eco & Sol, Montpellier, France; [Loreau, Michel] CNRS, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, Moulis, France; [Loreau, Michel] Paul Sabatier Univ, Moulis, France; [Violle, Cyrille] Univ Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, EPHE, UMR 5175,CEFE,CNRS, Montpellier, France; [Richon, Camille] CEA Orme Merisiers, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Gif Sur Yvette, France","Jaillard, B (corresponding author), INRA, Ecol Fonct & Biogeochim Sols & Agrosyst Eco & Sol, Montpellier, France.",benoit.jaillard@inra.fr,,,Effet d'echantillonnage sur la comprehension et la prediction du fonctionnement des ecosystemes (INRA); TULIP Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41]; French Foundation for Research on Biodiversity; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [ERC-StG-2014-639706],"Effet d'echantillonnage sur la comprehension et la prediction du fonctionnement des ecosystemes (INRA); TULIP Laboratory of Excellence, Grant/Award Number: ANR-10-LABX-41; French Foundation for Research on Biodiversity; European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: ERC-StG-2014-639706",,35,8,8,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

And one of them is the pollution of urban water bodies with different toxicants, such as heavy metals. In this study, the analysis of surface water bodies carried out to containing of some heavy metals, such as: Pb, Fe, Mn, Sr, Zn, Cd and Cu, as well as comparison of obtained results with the results of previous research in 2006. During the research it was found that the main heavy metal contaminating town water bodies is cadmium (Cd), which average concentration is thirtyfold higher then allowed statutory level of contaminants for water bodies to amenity needs. Maximal concentration of Cd is 37 MPC an (maximum permissible concentration in water bodies to amenity needs) was evidenced in the pond inside the industrial area. The other heavy metals found in water bodies and benthic sediments in concentrations 2-5 MPC an were Pb, Fe and Mn. The results were compared with the previous research data in 2006, and it should be noticed, that during the eleven years concentrations of Pb and Mn lowered a bit, but they are still higher than MPC an. At the same time, concentrations of Fe and Cd have slightly increased. In regards to heavy metals' concentrations in sediments, their dynamics changed a little. Basing to the obtained data, the specific combinatorial water pollution index (SCWPI) was calculated. This index characterizes water pollution rate, and for water bodies in Dzerzhinsky town SCWPI was 11 points, which indicates that surface waters in the town could be classified as strongly polluted waters.","[Riabova, E.

One application that is not fully explored yet is their use for assessing the species biodiversity and presence of invasive alien species (IAS) in maritime biosecurity. The phylogeographical signals of the mitochondrial COI (mtCOI) gene have been sometimes used to infer the number of introductions and the origin of biological invasions. Here, we employed mtCOI barcodes of mollusks and acorn barnacles (N= 751) from ports of French Polynesia to infer the effect of port size, maritime traffic, and degree of openness in the risk of biological invasions. With 17.2% of non-indigenous species (NIS) recorded here, significant differences in diversity were found among docks and between long-time docked ships and their closest piers. A higher proportion of NIS was found from sheltered compared to open ports regardless of their size and traffic. Less frequent wave washing, a lower effect of currents, and partial isolation in sheltered ports could explain the difference. The results suggest that port biota surveys should focus first on ports sheltered from the open sea and emphasize the value of mtCOI barcodes for the early detection of potential invasive species and for prioritizing surveillance efforts.","[Garcia-Vazquez, Eva; Ardura, Alba] Univ Oviedo, Dept Funct Biol, Oviedo, Spain; [Planes, Serge] Ctr Rech Insulaire & Observ Environm, USR CNRS EPHE 3278, Moorea, French Polynesi, France; [Planes, Serge] Ctr Rech Insulaire & Observ Environm, Lab Excellence CORAIL, Moorea, French Polynesi, France","Garcia-Vazquez, E (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, Dept Funct Biol, Oviedo, Spain.",egv@uniovi.es,,,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [MINECO CGL2016-79209-R]; Juan de la Cierva fellowship; IRCP-CRIOBE Grant (2018); Government of Asturias [IDI-2018-00020],"This study was funded from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under the Grant MINECO CGL2016-79209-R and the Government of Asturias Principality under the Grant IDI-2018-00020; 1.

Yet, this is seemingly at odds with substantial evidence that niches tend to be similar among closely related species (i.e. niche conservatism). Identifying the relative importance of these opposing processes in driving niche evolution under different circumstances is therefore essential to our understanding of the interaction between ecological and evolutionary phenomena. In this study, we make use of recent advances in our understanding of the phylogeny of kelps (Laminariales) to investigate niche evolution in one of the most ecologically significant groups of benthic habitat-forming organisms on the planet. We quantify functional traits and use community sampling data from a kelp diversity hotspot to determine which traits are responsible for the habitat (beta) niche of kelps and whether they are labile or conserved across the kelp phylogeny. We find that combinations of functional traits have evolved convergently across kelp subclades and that these functional traits are significant predictors of community structure. Specifically, traits associated with whole-kelp structural reinforcement and material properties were found to be significantly correlated with species distributions along a gradient of wave disturbance and thus predict the outcome of environmental filtering. However, kelp assemblages were made up of species that are more phylogenetically distinct than expected (i.e. phylogenetic overdispersion), suggesting that niche partitioning along this gradient of wave disturbance has been an important driver of divergence between close relatives. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that environmental filtering associated with wave disturbance plays an essential role in determining the habitat niche of kelps across local communities and further suggest that this process can drive phenotypic divergence and niche partitioning between close relatives. We propose that parallel adaptive radiation of kelp subclades has shaped the diversity and species composition of kelp forests in the Northeast Pacific and we discuss how evidence from the literature on incipient or ongoing speciation events supports this hypothesis.

Yet, current methods for recording kill rates of free-ranging predators, particularly those that consume small-bodied (<2 kg) prey, present a number of associated challenges. In this paper, we deployed custom-adapted acoustic recorders and tri-axial accelerometers on free-ranging Canada lynx Lynx canadensis to assess the capacity of biologging devices to continuously document individual hunting behaviour, including prey selection and kill rates, on a predator that specializes on prey weighing Automated classification of acoustic recordings captured 87% of snowshoe hare kills that were identified through snow-tracking (26 of 31 kills). Classification of detailed acceleration recordings summarized over minutes, instead of seconds, captured consumption of snowshoe hare Lepus americanus, but not smaller species, at high accuracy (F1 = 0.96). By summarizing acoustic and accelerometer data from free-ranging lynx, we demonstrate the capacity of these devices to document within- and between-individual variation in diet composition (ranging from 40% to 80% snowshoe hares) and daily feeding bouts (ranging from 0 to 3.5 bouts per day). We suggest that acoustic recorders provide a promising method for characterizing several aspects of predator hunting behaviour including prey selection and chase outcomes, while broad-scale accelerometer-based behavioural classifications provide hare kill rates and fine-scale non-hunting behavioural information. Combined, the two technologies provide a means to remotely document both kills and feeding events of small-bodied prey, allowing for individual-based exploration of functional responses, predator-prey interactions and food web dynamics at temporal scales relevant to environmental change.","[Studd, Emily K.; Boutin, Stan] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Studd, Emily K.; Menzies, Allyson K.; Humphries, Murray M.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ, Canada; [Derbyshire, Rachael E.; Murray, Dennis L.] Trent Univ, Dept Biol, Peterborough, ON, Canada","Studd, EK (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada.; Studd, EK (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ, Canada.",studd@ualberta.ca,"; Boutin, Stan/A-2619-2014","Menzies, Allyson/0000-0003-2280-1880; Derbyshire, Rachael/0000-0002-6672-7996; Boutin, Stan/0000-0001-6317-038X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); W.

Decomposition of litter is a key biochemical process that regulates the rate and magnitude of CO2 fluxes from biosphere to atmosphere and determines soil nutrient availability. Although several studies have shown that plant litter decomposition accelerated in their native compared to a foreign environment, that is, a home-field advantage (HFA) for litter degradation, to date HFA has only been considered in terms of respiration or litter mass loss. 2. The competitive success of the decomposer micro-organism will be determined by its ability to transform used OM into population growth. Therefore, we hypothesized that HFA for microbial growth would be more pronounced than that for decomposition. We also expected that HFA effect for decomposition and microbial growth would increase with lower quality litter, which the fungal role in litter decomposition would be more dominant than that of bacteria, and that HFA effects would strengthen with more pronounced differences between 'home' and 'away' environments. 3. We designed a 2-month microcosm reciprocal transplant experiment with litter from two sites with contrasting climates (Atlantic and Sub-Mediterranean climates) and including three tree species (Quercus robur, Pinus sylvestris and Fagus sylvatica). 4. We found a stronger HFA for microbial growth than for decomposition, that the nutrient content and C-quality of litter influenced the microbial HFA and that interactions between bacterial and fungal communities during litter decomposition modulated the HFA for litter degradation. 5. Low litter nutrient content, strong nutrient limitations and low C-qualities all favoured fungal over bacterial decomposers, and our results suggest a dominant functional role of the fungal community and gave rise to HFA effect for fungal growth but that this translated to only marginal implications for overall decomposition of litter.","[Benito-Carnero, Garazi; Gartzia-Bengoetxea, Nahia; Arias-Gonzalez, Ander] NEIKER Basque Inst Agr Res & Dev, Dept Forest Sci, Zamudio, Spain; [Rousk, Johannes] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Microbial Ecol, MEMEG, Lund, Sweden","Benito-Carnero, G (corresponding author), NEIKER Basque Inst Agr Res & Dev, Dept Forest Sci, Zamudio, Spain.",garazi.benito@gmail.com,"Rousk, Johannes/E-9741-2010","Rousk, Johannes/0000-0002-4985-7262","COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [FP1305]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [2015-04942, 2020-04083]; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [2018-01315]; Knut and Alice Wallenberg FoundationKnut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation [KAW 2017.0171]; INIAInstituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA) [FPI2014-040]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [RTA2012-00048-00-00]; Department of Economic Development and Infrastructure of the Basque Government","COST Action, Grant/Award Number: FP1305; Swedish Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 2015-04942 and 2020-04083; Swedish Research Council Formas, Grant/Award Number: 2018-01315; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, Grant/Award Number: KAW 2017.0171; INIA, Grant/Award Number: FPI2014-040; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Grant/Award Number: RTA2012-00048-00-00; Department of Economic Development and Infrastructure of the Basque Government",,61,0,0,39,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

However, forest resilience is likely to vary over gradients of topoclimate and vegetation characteristics, and the influences of local climate and tree species on tree regeneration remain key uncertainties in assessing forest recovery from wildfire. We surveyed tree regeneration 9-15 yr post-fire at 397 gridded field plots across four sites at a lower montane forest-steppe ecotone in the eastern Sierra Nevada, California, USA, and then used statistical modeling to characterize how the probability of tree regeneration presence for different species varied along gradients of fire severity, topoclimate, and post-fire vegetation structure and composition. Tree regeneration was absent in half the field plots, and only 19% of plots contained >250 seedlings and saplings per ha, suggesting potential for regeneration failure and forest loss. Tree regeneration composition was consistent with shifts away from Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) and toward drought-tolerant pinyon pine (P. monophylla) and mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius). Tree regeneration was strongly associated with trees that survived fire indicating tree cover is crucial to buffer establishment against climatic stress. Based on projected future water balance, the likelihood of tree regeneration at these sites does not decline substantially by the end of the century. Consequently, these forests appear to be resilient to climate change under a low-severity fire regime, but large patches of high-severity fire are likely to shift vegetation away from forest. Our results highlight the importance of facilitation and future water balance in maintaining semi-arid forest margins that burn at low severity while high-severity fire threatens to convert forest to steppe or invasive grasslands.","[Harris, Lucas B.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, 302 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Taylor, Alan H.] Penn State Univ, Earth & Environm Syst Inst, Dept Geog, 302 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Harris, LB (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, 302 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",lbh146@psu.edu,,,NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1735558]; Center for Landscape Dynamics research award; Ruby S.

Competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal (CSR) theory is a prominent plant functional strategy scheme previously applied to local floras. Globally, the wide geographic and phylogenetic coverage of available values of leaf area (LA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA) (representing, respectively, interspecific variation in plant size and conservative vs. acquisitive resource economics) promises the general application of CSR strategies across biomes, including the tropical forests hosting a large proportion of Earth's diversity. 2. We used trait variation for 3068 tracheophytes (representing 198 families, six continents and 14 biomes) to create a globally calibrated CSR strategy calculator tool and investigate strategy-environment relationships across biomes world-wide. 3. Due to disparity in trait availability globally, co-inertia analysis was used to check correspondence between a 'wide geographic coverage, few traits' data set and a 'restricted coverage, many traits' subset of 371 species for which 14 whole-plant, flowering, seed and leaf traits (including leaf nitrogen content) were available. CSR strategy/environment relationships within biomes were investigated using fourth-corner and RLQ analyses to determine strategy/climate specializations. 4. Strong, significant concordance (RV = 0.597; P < 0.0001) was evident between the 14 trait multivariate space and when only LA, LDMC and SLA were used. 5. Biomes such as tropical moist broadleaf forests exhibited strategy convergence (i.e. clustered around a CS/CSR median; C:S:R = 43: 42: 15%), with CS-selection associated with warm, stable situations (lesser temperature seasonality), with greater annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Other biomes were characterized by strategy divergence: for example, deserts varied between xeromorphic perennials such as Larrea divaricata, classified as S-selected (C: S: R = 1:99:0%) and broadly R-selected annual herbs (e.g. Claytonia perfoliata; R/CR-selected; C:S:R = 21:0:79%). Strategy convergence was evident for several growth habits (e.g. trees) but not others (forbs). 6. The CSR strategies of vascular plants can now be compared quantitatively within and between biomes at the global scale. Through known linkages between underlying leaf traits and growth rates, herbivory and decomposition rates, this method and the strategy-environment relationships it elucidates will help to predict which kinds of species may assemble in response to changes in biogeochemical cycles, climate and land use.","[Pierce, Simon; Luzzaro, Alessandra] Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Environm Sci DiSAA, Via G Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Negreiros, Daniel; Barbosa, Newton P.

While many methods for estimating the ET0 have been developed during the past several decades, method selection essentially depends on the availability of measured climatic variables. The FAO-56PM method recommended by experts from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is widely used in agricultural and environmental research to estimate the ET0. However, it requires several climatic parameters that are not always available in developing countries, especially in arid regions. Here, we compare and evaluate the performance of 13 widely- and commonly-used equations for estimating ET0 against that predicted using the FAO-56PM model using climatic data from nine meteorological stations located in arid regions across Iran. On average, the best three methods that could be used as an alternative to the FAO-56PM equation were the Irmak (Irmak et al., 2003), Hargreaves-Samani (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985), and Hargreaves (1975) equations.","[Nazari, M.] McGill Univ Canada, Dept Plant Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Chaichi, M.

Phosphorus (P) has long been considered the primary limiting element in lowland forests, but recent evidence demonstrates substantial heterogeneity in response to nutrient addition, highlighting a need to understand and diagnose nutrient limitation across diverse forests. Fine-root characteristics including their abundance, functional traits, and mycorrhizal symbionts can be highly responsive to changes in soil nutrients and may help to diagnose nutrient limitation. Here, we document the response of fine roots to long-term nitrogen (N), P, and potassium (K) fertilization in a lowland forest in Panama. Because this experiment has demonstrated that N and K together limit tree growth and P limits fine litter production, we hypothesized that fine roots would also respond to nutrient addition. Specifically we hypothesized that N, P, and K addition would reduce the biomass, diameter, tissue density, and mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots, and increase nutrient concentration in root tissue. Most morphological root traits responded to the single addition of K and the paired addition of N and P, with the greatest response to all three nutrients combined. The addition of N, P, and K together reduced fine-root biomass, length, and tissue density, and increased specific root length, whereas root diameter remained unchanged. Nitrogen addition did not alter root N concentration, but P and K addition increased root P and K concentration, respectively. Mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots declined with N, increased with P, and was unresponsive to K addition. Although plant species composition remains unchanged after 14 years of fertilization, fine-root characteristics responded to N, P, and K addition, providing some of the strongest stand-level responses in this experiment. Multiple soil nutrients regulate fine-root abundance, morphological and chemical traits, and their association with mycorrhizal fungi in a species-rich lowland tropical forest.","[Wurzburger, Nina] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Wright, S.

In arid lands, grassland ecosystems tend to be vulnerable and have been degraded due to the influence of human activities. The total area of the natural grasslands in Xinjiang, a large region in arid north-western China, ranks third in terms of area in China. In the process of grassland degradation, poisonous plants have spread widely and quickly in this region. During recent years, increasing economic losses have been caused by poisonous plants in Xinjiang. Although poisonous plants have been reported at some specific locations, their spatial patterns have rarely been investigated at a large regional scale. To understand the current status of hazards and assess the invasion risks of poisonous plants, we sampled similar to 150 poisonous plant species from Xinjiang and modelled the present and the future (the 2050s and the 2070s) distribution of 90 species using species distribution modelling. Based on the distribution maps of these poisonous plants, four diversity hotspots of poisonous plants were identified in Xinjiang. The results showed that northern Xinjiang had higher levels of poisonous plant diversity compared with the other part of Xinjiang. The precipitation factors had the most influence on prediction of the poisonous plants distributions in the species distribution modelling. Under the scenarios of future climate change, the results of modelling showed that regions close to the four hotspots of poisonous plants in Xinjiang displayed higher risks of invasion by poisonous plants in the future. In addition, these areas with a high risk of plant invasion will become increasingly large. We propose that policy makers consider implementing monitoring and prevention measures in areas identified as having a high risk of future invasion by poisonous plants.","[Zhang, Hong-Xiang; Zhang, Ming-Li; Wang, Yong] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Key Lab Biogeog & Bioresource Arid Land, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ming-Li] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Zhang, ML (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Key Lab Biogeog & Bioresource Arid Land, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.; Zhang, ML (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",zhanghx561@ms.xjb.ac.cn; zhangml@ibcas.ac.cn,,,Young Doctor Science and Technology Talents Training Project of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region [qn2015bs016],The editors and anonymous referees are acknowledged for their valuable comments that improved the earlier version of this paper.

Nine sites were chosen, including grasslands at different elevations, a bog and a glacier foreland site at the lower alpine zone and a snowbed at the upper alpine zone. Data were acquired by frequency counts in 1 m(2) permanent plots inside each fenced area (three plots per site) and outside in grazed areas (three plots), Diversity indices and functional diversity were analyzed by means of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), Exclosure, duration of exclusion and exclosureyears (interaction effect) were defined as predictor variables, Multivariate ordination techniques were used to (i) determine species responses to grazing exclusion (pRDA, partial redundancy analysis) and (ii) to create a distance matrix representing the changes between exclosures and control plots per year (NMDS, non-metric multidimensional scaling). At the subalpine grassland, first differences between exclosure and control plots occurred already only after three years, at the upper alpine zone after four and five years. Contrary to our expectation, dwarf shrubs did not increase within the exclosures of the subalpine grassland. Instead, mainly the tall forb Geranium sylvaticuin increased. Species richness significantly decreased at the exclosures of the subalpine zone, the snowbed and at one upper alpine grassland sites. The communities of the glacier foreland and the hog were hardly affected by grazing exclusion. We conclude that plant species and communities react individually depending on elevation and grazing animals.

Long-distance avian migrants are known to move with the seasonal dynamics on an annual basis, but how individuals respond to seasonality within their tropical non-breeding range has been less studied. Here we analyse the movement pattern of a highly mobile aerial insectivorous bird, the pallid swift Apus pallidus, and its association with the local habitat phenology during the non-breeding period, using individual-based light-level geolocation. We extracted timing and location of 21 birds' residence periods, as well as characteristics of the intervening movements, such as distance and speed. We used time series of precipitation and vegetation data for each residence area to extract the timing of the local end of the rainy season and the onset of the dry season. The pallid swifts repeatedly upgraded their habitat by undertaking 2-5 intra-tropical migrations correlated with the withdrawal of the rains and the onset of the local dry season. The birds arrived to the sites on average 12 days after rains ended and departed about two weeks after the onset of dry season suggesting that the birds closely tracked a spatiotemporal window presumably timed with optimal foraging conditions. Our results provide insights in the ways Palaearctic-African migrants respond to the asynchronous phenology within their sub-Saharan non-breeding range. We confirmed that pallid swifts actively respond to deteriorating conditions by repeated upgrades in habitat quality, which likely have substantial consequences for an individual's access to an essential, spatiotemporally ephemeral food resource. However, the pallid swifts did not surf an apparent resource wave per se as would be expected in a highly mobile species, indicating that also other factors, such as spatial patchiness of resources, may influence the movement decision.","[Norevik, Gabriel; Hedenstrom, Anders; Akesson, Susanne] Lund Univ, Ctr Anim Movement Res, Dept Biol, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Boano, Giovanni] Museo Civico Storia Nat, Carmagnola, TO, Italy; [Lardelli, Roberto; Liechti, Felix] Swiss Ornithol Inst, Bird Migrat, Sempach, Switzerland","Norevik, G (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Anim Movement Res, Dept Biol, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",gabriel.norevik@biol.lu.se,"Akesson, Susanne/F-3175-2015; Hedenstrom, Anders/F-5377-2010","Akesson, Susanne/0000-0001-9039-2180; Liechti, Felix/0000-0001-9473-0837; Boano, Giovanni/0000-0002-2670-4351; Hedenstrom, Anders/0000-0002-1757-0945","Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [621-2013-4361]; Linnaeus grant from the Swedish Research Council [349-2007-8690]; Lund University; Swiss federal office for environment [254, 332, 363, 400]","The project was funded by project grants to SA from the Swedish Research Council (621-2013-4361).

To shed light on links between climate and N cycling in tropical forests, we measured bulk surface soil C and N concentrations and isotopic content at 40 forested sites spanning an 1800 m elevation transect in Central America, possessing wide variation in mean annual temperature (MAT; range = 10 degrees C) and precipitation (MAP; range = 1.2 m). Climate and terrain attributes were extracted from gridded data sets and regressed against soil variables, and then, empirical relationships were combined with a mass balance model to scale up to the larger landscape. Across the remote study region, elevation and soil delta N-15 values displayed a strong negative relationship, while elevation was positively related to percent of soil C, N, and C: N ratios. As elevation was tightly correlated with MAT and MAP, soil chemical and isotopic content varied strongly with climate. For example, for every degree increase in MAT, soil delta N-15 values-an indicator of relative gaseous N losses-increased by a factor of 0.4, and soil C: N ratios, which affect net N mineralization and N availability, declined by a factor of 1.1. With the 40 sites binned into bioclimatic life zones, montane, premontane, and wet-premontane transition forests showed distinct clustering of soil chemical and isotopic properties, yet forest type alone explained less variation compared to continuous elevation-climate parameters. Results of the spatially applied N-15 mass balance model implied shifts in the contribution of gaseous-to-total N loss, from 10% or less in cool, wet high-elevation forests to upwards of 60% at warmer, drier, low-elevation sites. Climate variation was thus associated with significant shifts in N dynamics across this montane tropical region, yet more work is needed to decouple direct vs. indirect climatic controls. While the mechanisms deserve further study, observed shifts in indicators of N availability and gaseous loss may be useful in managing and modeling tropical forests under climate change.","[Weintraub, Samantha R.; Cole, Rebecca J.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Schmitt, Carl G.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Mesoscale & Microscale Meteorol Div, Boulder, CO 80301 USA; [All, John D.] Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Geog & Geol, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA; [Weintraub, Samantha R.] Natl Ecol Observ Network, 1685 38th St,100, Boulder, CO 80301 USA; [Cole, Rebecca J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Hilo, HI 96720 USA","Weintraub, SR (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.; Weintraub, SR (corresponding author), Natl Ecol Observ Network, 1685 38th St,100, Boulder, CO 80301 USA.",weintrsr@colorado.edu,"Schmitt, Carl G/P-5490-2015","All, John/0000-0002-1401-971X; Schmitt, Carl/0000-0003-3829-6970",ACSP volunteers; NSF Postdoctoral FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF 10-02586],"We thank Marvin Lopez Morales and two indigenous guides for their assistance executing the difficult cross-Talamanca expedition.

The dump preparation involved leveling the technogenic eluvium and its subsequent covering with (1) a 10-cm layer of fertile topsoil (FTS) taken from heaps of soil removed and piled prior to the dump formation or (2) a 10-cm layer of potentially fertile undersoil (PFUS) consisting of loesslike loam from the overburden dump. A flat site on a sandstone dump with a lithogenically undeveloped soil layer without the application of FTS or PFUS was used as the control. The herbal-seed mixture (HSM) was procured in summer and fall in Bachatskie Sopki regional botanical reserve on steppe slopes, whose vegetation is constituted by meadow-steppe plant communities with the predomination of S. capillata. The experimental and control sites were monitored for 5 years, from 2015 to 2019. The variant with loamy undersoil provides the best conditions for the growth and development of S. capillata: some individuals start blossoming as early as in the first year; in the third year, all plants blossom and fruit; and, in the fifth year, the share of S. capillata in the total productivity amounts to 83.6%. The plants form a thick sod layer and successfully compete with weeds. In the variant with FTS, the share of S. capillata was 4-8% in 2015-2018 and reached 30.1% only in 2019. The suppression of S. capillata in this variant is caused by the high competitiveness of the species Elytrigia repens (L.) Nevski, whose rhizomes were brought to the dump together with FTS from the soil heaps. In the control variant, an S. capillata community was noted in the fifth-fourth years; apparently, it originates from seeds dispersed from the experimental variants.","[Kupriyanov, A.

However, theory suggests that native and invasive species occurring in low-resource environments will be functionally similar, as environmental factors restrict the range of observed physiological and morphological trait values. We measured resource-use traits in native and invasive plant species across eight diverse vegetation communities distributed throughout the five mediterranean-climate regions, which are drought prone and increasingly threatened by human activities, including the introduction of exotic species. Traits differed strongly across the five regions. In regions with functional differences between native and invasive species groups, invasive species displayed traits consistent with high resource acquisition; however, these patterns were largely attributable to differences in life form. We found that species invading mediterranean-climate regions were more likely to be annual than perennial: three of the five regions were dominated by native woody species and invasive annuals. These results suggest that trait differences between native and invasive species are context dependent and will vary across vegetation communities. Native and invasive species within annual and perennial groups had similar patterns of carbon assimilation and resource use, which contradicts the widespread idea that invasive species optimize resource acquisition rather than resource conservation.","[Funk, Jennifer L.] Chapman Univ, Schmid Coll Sci & Technol, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Standish, Rachel J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Standish, Rachel J.] Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; [Stock, William D.] Edith Cowan Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Management, Joondalup, WA 6027, Australia; [Valladares, Fernando] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Valladares, Fernando] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Ciencias, Madrid, Spain","Funk, JL (corresponding author), Chapman Univ, Schmid Coll Sci & Technol, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",jlfunk@chapman.edu,"Standish, Rachel J/B-1028-2011; Funk, Jennifer/AAX-9325-2021; Funk, Jennifer/AAL-6185-2021","Funk, Jennifer/0000-0002-1916-5513",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OISE-1132994]; Stanford UniversityStanford University; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental DecisionsAustralian Research Council,"We thank F.

Pollution is a global issue at the frontier between ecology, environmental science, management, engineering and policy. Legislation requires experiments to determine how much contamination an ecosystem can absorb before there are structural or functional changes. Yet, existing methods cannot realistically simulate regimes of chemical disturbance and determine impacts to assemblages in ecosystems. This is because they lack ecologically relevant species and biotic interactions, are logistically difficult to set up and lack environmentally relevant regimes of chemical and abiotic disturbance that organisms experience in polluted areas. 2. We solved these long-standing environmental, logistical, experimental and ecological problems by developing a programmable dosing system. This dosing system simulates, in situ, regimes of chemical disturbance to assemblages by manipulating the concentration, duration, timing and frequency of pollutants to which they are exposed. 3. Experiments with priority pollutants (the metal copper and the biocide chlorpyrifos) and mussel assemblages revealed consistent plumes of contamination within patches of mussel. Mussels at the sources of experimental plumes of copper created by the dosing system, accumulated 670% more copper in their tissues compared to mussels 0.5-50 m away. In addition, when mussels were exposed to increasing concentrations of copper, there was a concomitant increase in the amount of copper in the tissues of mussels. Combining the dosing system with an established hierarchy of ecotoxicological assays revealed mussel assemblages exposed to copper and/or chlorpyrifos had 40-70% fewer worms, whilst chlorpyrifos alone caused an 81% reduction in the number of amphipods and caused mussels to filter 48% fewer particles from the water. Combinations of copper and/or chlorpyrifos had no effects on the abundance of crabs, the respiratory functions of assemblages or the viability of molluscan haemocytes. 4. As global contamination accelerates, we discuss how this technological advance will enable a diverse array of ecologists, mangers and policy-makers to understand and reduce pollution.","[Browne, Mark Anthony; Brooks, Paul R.; Crowe, Tasman P.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sci Ctr West, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Browne, Mark Anthony; Pinto, Mariana Mayer] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Browne, Mark Anthony; Pinto, Mariana Mayer] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Browne, Mark Anthony] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, 735 State St,Suite 300, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; [Clough, Robert; Fisher, Andrew S.] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Portland Sq, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England","Browne, MA (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sci Ctr West, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland.; Browne, MA (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.; Browne, MA (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.; Browne, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, 735 State St,Suite 300, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA.",m.browne@unsw.edu.au,,"Browne, Mark Anthony/0000-0002-7508-1015; Mayer-Pinto, Mariana/0000-0001-9679-7023; Brooks, Paul/0000-0002-8105-0813","Irish Research Councils (IRC-SET, IRCHSS); UCD's Graduate Research Education Programme (GREP) in Sustainable Development; IRCSET Post-Doctoral FellowshipIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology; UCD's GREP on Sustainable Development","Equipment was purchased through funding by Irish Research Councils (IRC-SET, IRCHSS) and UCD's Graduate Research Education Programme (GREP) in Sustainable Development.

Both the strength and direction of natural selection on interacting populations vary with the community context, which itself is changed by these interactions. Here, we test for the role of interacting evolutionary and ecological processes in plant-herbivore interactions during early community succession in the tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima. We use surveys in a large-scale field experiment with repeated plots representing 6 years of early oldfield succession and reciprocal transplant common garden experiments to test for the relative importance of rapid evolution (genetic) and environmental changes (soil quality) in affecting mean plant resistance and growth phenotypes during community succession. While plant growth varied strongly with soil quality over the first 5 years of agricultural abandonment, plant secondary metabolism, and herbivore resistance varied minimally with the soil environment. Instead, mean composition and abundance of plant secondary compound bouquets differed between S. altissima plants from populations collected in communities in the first (early) and sixth (intermediate) years of oldfield succession, which was reflected in the feeding preference of the specialist herbivore, Trirhabda virgata, for early succession lines. Moreover, this preference was most pronounced on poorer quality, early succession soils. Overall, our data demonstrate that plant quality varies for insect herbivores during the course of early succession and this change is a combination of altered genotypic composition of the population and phenotypic plasticity in different soil environments.","[Howard, Mia M.] Cornell Univ, Plant Biol Sect, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Kalske, Aino; Kessler, Andre] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Kessler, A (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",ak357@cornell.edu,,"Kessler, Andre/0000-0002-1797-7518; Howard, Mia/0000-0003-4940-0366; Kalske, Aino/0000-0003-3850-8996",Sustainable Biodiversity Fund grant from the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future; Kone Foundation; Multistate Hatch Grant [NE-1501]; Federal Capacity Funds from Cornell University Agricultural Experiment Station through the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NYC-183855],"We thank Isabella Swyst, Alex Stotter, Anupreksha Jain, and Alex Chauta for their help with field and laboratory work; Drs.

However, only few of them are considered agricultural pests. Life history traits such as high fecundity, fast population growth, and high dispersal ability have been used to characterize agricultural pest insects. However, many other non-pest insects also share these traits, which indicates that there has not been a decisive condition characterizing agricultural pest insects. Agricultural habitats are risky and ephemeral to pests because of pest control and harvesting. The usual arithmetic mean fitness cannot be used to measure the persistence of these pests, because the maximal mean fitness is achieved only when they exhibit no dispersal, but that leads to immediate extinction. Using ageometric mean fitness model, we propose a quantitative measure of long-term reproductive success for agricultural pest insects. By usingthis approach, we can evaluate the trade-off between long-distance dispersal and high reproduction correctly and estimate the condition for the long-term persistence of pest insects in agricultural habitats. We discuss some general perspectives of pest control from the proposed characterization.","[Gavina, Maica Krizna Areja; Rabajante, Jomar Fajardo; Ito, Hiromu; Yoshimura, Jin] Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Naka Ku, 3-5-1 Johoku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 4328561, Japan; [Gavina, Maica Krizna Areja; Rabajante, Jomar Fajardo] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Div Math, Inst Math Sci & Phys, Laguna 4031, Philippines; [Aoki, Kotaro; Ichinose, Genki; Morita, Satoru; Yoshimura, Jin] Shizuoka Univ, Dept Math & Syst Engn, Naka Ku, 3-5-1 Johoku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 4328561, Japan; [Ito, Hiromu] Nagasaki Univ, Inst Trop Med, Dept Int Hlth, Nagasaki 8528523, Japan; [Ito, Hiromu] Univ Tokyo, Dept Gen Syst Studies, 3-8-2 Meguro, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Jansen, Vincent A.

This has been clearly demonstrated for individual plant species, but it is unknown how locally adapted microbes may affect plant communities. It is possible that the adaptation of microbial communities to local conditions can shape plant community composition. Additionally, it is possible that the effects of locally adapted microorganisms on individual plant species could be altered by co-occurring plant species. We tested these possibilities in plant community mesocosms with soils and mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) from three locations. We found that plant community biomass responded positively to local adaptation of AMF to soil conditions. Plant community composition also changed in response to local adaptation of AMF. Unexpectedly, the strongest benefits of locally adapted AMF went to early successional plant species that have the highest relative growth rates and the lowest responsiveness to the presence of AMF. Late successional plants that responded positively overall to the presence of AMF were often suppressed in communities with local AMF, perhaps because of strong competition from fast growing plant species. These results show that local adaptation of soil microbial communities can shape plant community composition, and the benefits that plants derive from locally adapted microorganisms can be reshaped by the competitive context in which these associations occur.","[Bauer, Jonathan T.] Miami Univ, Dept Biol, 700 E High St, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Bauer, Jonathan T.] Miami Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, 250 S Patterson Ave, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Koziol, Liz; Bever, James D.] Kansas Biol Survey, 2101 Constant Ave, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; [Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1200 Sunnyside Ave, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Bauer, JT (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Biol, 700 E High St, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.; Bauer, JT (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, 250 S Patterson Ave, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",bauerjt@miamioh.edu,"Koziol, Liz/AAX-5972-2020",,"Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program grant [RC-2330]; National Science Foundation grantsNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1556664, 1656006]; United States Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture Grant [2016-67012-24680]","This work was supported by Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program grant RC-2330 and National Science Foundation grants 1556664 and 1656006 to JDB and United States Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture Grant 2016-67012-24680 to JTB.

Movement is crucial in metapopulation ecology because it facilitates colonization and reduces the likelihood of local extinction via rescue effects. Most metapopulation modeling approaches describe connectivity using pair-wise Euclidean distances resulting in the simplifying assumption of a symmetric connectivity pattern. Yet, assuming symmetric connectivity when populations show net asymmetric movement patterns may result in biased estimates of colonization and extinction, and may alter interpretations of the dynamics and conclusions regarding the viability of metapopulations. Here, we use a 10-year time series on a wind-dispersed orchid Lepanthes rupestris that anchors its roots in patches of moss growing on trees or boulders along streams, to test for the role of connectivity asymmetries in explaining the colonization-extinction dynamics of this orchid in a network of 975 patches. We expected that wind direction could highly alter dispersal direction in this orchid. To account for this potential asymmetry, we modified the connectivity measure traditionally used in metapopulation models to allow for asymmetric effective distances between patches and subsequently estimated colonization and extinction probabilities using a dynamic occupancy modeling approach. Asymmetric movement was prevalent in the L. rupestris metapopulation and incorporating potential dispersal asymmetries resulted in higher colonization estimates in larger patches and more accurate models. Accounting for dispersal asymmetries may reveal connectivity effects where they were previously assumed to be negligible and may provide more reliable conclusions regarding the role of connectivity in patch dynamics.","[Acevedo, Miguel A.] Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Acevedo, Miguel A.; Fletcher, Robert J., Jr.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Tremblay, Raymond L.] Univ Puerto Rico Humacao, Dept Biol, Humacao, PR 00792 USA; [Melendez-Ackerman, Elvia J.] Univ Puerto Rico Rio Piedras, Dept Environm Sci, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Tremblay, Raymond L.; Melendez-Ackerman, Elvia J.] Univ Puerto Rico, Ctr Appl Trop Ecol & Conservat, San Juan, PR 00931 USA","Acevedo, M (corresponding author), Sch Nat Resources & Environm, POB 110430, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",miguel.acevedo7@upr.edu,"Tremblay, Raymond L/Q-3763-2019","Tremblay, Raymond L/0000-0002-8588-4372","National Science Foundation (NSF) Quantitative Spatial Ecology, Evolution and Environment Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship Program at the University of Florida [0801544]; NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1110441]; School of Natural Resources and Environment; Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation at the University of Florida; Center for Applied Tropical Ecology and Conservation [NSF-HRD 0734826]","This work greatly benefited from discussions with B.

The presence of source patches, however, may facilitate persistence of species-supersaturation in the face of invaders. We explore that notion here through simulation analyses of more detailed spatially explicit models depicting one- and two-dimensional systems (pipe and two-eddy models, respectively) where water circulation is governed over a range of advection and turbulent diffusion. For the pipe model, when advection and turbulent diffusion are low, and when advection is high and turbulent diffusion is low, resident assemblages are more resistant to invaders. But at intermediate rates of advection and with increases to turbulent diffusion, assemblages are more quickly impacted by invaders. For the two-eddy model, when advection and turbulent diffusion are low, resident assemblages are again resistant to invaders, but only for lumpy assemblages. In contrast to the pipe model, resistance to invaders of neutral and lumpy assemblages is high when advection and turbulent diffusion are high. For both model configurations, intransitive assemblages were much more sensitive to invaders, suggesting that intransitivity might not be as prevalent a biodiversity-sustaining mechanism in spatially heterogeneous plankton systems.

Trophic mismatches occur when phenological responses to environmental conditions differ among trophic levels such that the timing of resource demand by consumers becomes decoupled from supply. We used 25 years of demographic measurements of a migratory songbird (the black-throated blue warbler Setophaga caerulescens) to compare its breeding phenology to the phenology of both its caterpillar prey and the foliage on which caterpillars feed. Caterpillar biomass in this forest did not show a predictable seasonal pulse. Nest initiation by warblers in this northern hardwood forest was therefore not timed to coincide with a peak in food availability for nestlings. Nonetheless, timing of first clutches was strongly associated with spring leaf expansion (slope +/- SE = 0.56 +/- 0.08 days per day of change in leaf phenology, R-2 = 0.66). Warblers adjusted the timing of breeding to early springs mainly by shortening the interval between arrival and clutch initiation, but this likely has limits because recent early springs are approaching the relatively inflexible dates when birds arrive on the breeding grounds. Although the timing of first nests did not match 1:1 with leaf-out phenology, the adjustments in breeding time maximized mean annual reproductive success. Nest predation had the greatest effect on annual reproductive success, but the ability of nesting warblers to appropriately track leaf phenology accounted for effects on annual reproductive success comparable to the influence of variation in caterpillar abundance and conspecific density. Nesting phenology in black-throated blue warblers was generally well matched to the timing of leaf-out, even though the match was not 1:1. Without measurements of reproductive success, these unequal phenological shifts might otherwise have been interpreted as having negative ecological consequences.","[Lany, Nina K.; Ayres, Matthew P.; Holmes, Richard T.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, 78 Coll St,Class 1978 Life Sci Ctr, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Stange, Erik E.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-2624 Lillehammer, Norway; [Sillett, T.

More than 50% of the global human population lives in urban settings, which, for urban agglomerations with > 1 million inhabitants, span a 30 degrees C range in mean annual temperature and 4000 mm annual precipitation range. 2. Although the biodiversity impacts of urbanization are most commonly investigated at the assemblage level, these impacts are mediated through organismal physiology and behaviour. 3. At the individual level, mechanistic models, which provide an explicit means to understand how organisms meet the requirements of heat, water and nutrient balance, offer a useful way to assess physiological and behavioural responses to urban environments and their consequences for population dynamics. 4. Physiological determinants of assemblage variation can usefully be investigated by examining entry, exit and transformation rules. These are biases in the processes that determine which individuals join or leave a population or assemblage, and processes that act on individuals, which remain part thereof. 5. Direct evidence for physiological adaptation (broadly construed as phenotypic plasticity, genotypic change or some interaction between them) to urban environments is remarkably limited, owing largely to low numbers of investigations, given that most studies that have been conducted reveal some form of adaptation. 6. A warming tolerance approach, applied to insects globally, demonstrates that transposing sampled populations to the nearest urban area reduces warming tolerance by several degrees, though this effect is on average more marked for the Southern than the Northern Hemisphere. The lowest warming tolerance is found between 30 and 35 degrees N or S, suggesting that in the absence of mitigation, the urban heat island effect of cities here will have the most pronounced impacts on insect populations. 7. Physiological approaches offer a useful means for understanding the urban-rural gradient across a wide range of climatically variable settings during a period of background environmental change.","[Chown, Steven L.; Duffy, Grant A.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia","Chown, SL (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",steven.chown@monash.edu,"Chown, Steven L/H-3347-2011; Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014","Chown, Steven L/0000-0001-6069-5105; Duffy, Grant/0000-0002-9031-8164",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP140101240],We thank Karl Evans and Amy Hahs for their invitation to contribute this work and their useful comments at various stage of the process.

Effective conservation of northern fur seals depends on understanding the foraging behavior of adult females whose foraging success is linked to pup survival. We determined the foraging behavior for 11 tagged lactating female northern fur seals from the Pribilof Islands using a state-space modeling approach with an autoregressive movement model. To interpret at-sea behavior in the context of oceanic habitat, we spatially and temporally matched high-resolution reconstructed tracks to a set of environmental covariates that included: commercial groundfish catch, sea surface temperature, primary productivity, wind speed, depth and time of day. We used a Bayesian hierarchical framework to implement a multinomial regression model to link behavior to environmental covariates and account for the mismatch of scale between fur seal behavior and the environmental variables by incorporating an error-in- covariates approach into the hierarchical model. The Bayesian framework allowed us to build a single model to synthesize the information from all the northern fur seal foraging tracks and the available information about the underlying environmental conditions. Application of the approach indicated that the behavioral states for the northern fur seal were significantly related to the Alaska commercial groundfish catch, particularly walleye pollock (Gadus chalogramma).","[Joy, Ruth; Routledge, Richard D.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Dowd, Michael G.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Battaile, Brian C.; Lestenkof, Pamela M.; Trites, Andrew W.] Univ British Columbia, Marine Mammal Res Unit, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Sterling, Jeremy T.] Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Mammal Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","Joy, R (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",rutherfordjoy@gmail.com,,"Trites, Andrew/0000-0003-0342-5322",NSERC Canadian Graduate ScholarshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Tula Foundation Research Scholarship; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); North Pacific Universities Marine Mammal Research consortium; North Pacific Research Board,"R.

These new selection pressures can be accommodated by different mechanisms that act on different levels and across different time scales: (1) By changing transcriptomic profiles, species can react by plasticity within individual physiological limitations. (2) Invasive populations can adapt by fixing beneficial genetic variants in response to the newly encountered selection pressures. Here, we compare the genomic and transcriptomic landscapes of two independent invasions of the Pacific Oyster (Crassostrea gigas) into the North Sea. In detail, we combine ddRAD sequencing on the genomic level with RNAseq on the transcriptomic level to reveal outlier loci (SNPs) indicative of adaptation, as well as transcriptomic profiles from a translocation experiment to show immediate physiological reactions between two populations characterizing the two independent invasions. Generally, we found low physical congruence between differentially regulated genes and outlier loci, indicating that different genes are involved on the different time scales. Functionally matching outlier loci and differentially expressed genes were however found for spliceosomal modification of mRNA and particularly for transposon activation, indicating that these variation creating processes might be connected across eco-physiological and evolutionary time scales. By contrasting and identifying functional congruence between population outlier loci and population specific transcriptomic profiles, we can thus reveal a glimpse at the traits and processes characterizing specific mechanisms involved in successful invasions.","[Wegner, K.

The structure of these networks is usually characterised by calculating one or more indices that capture different aspects of network architecture. While these indices capture useful properties of networks, they are relatively insensitive to changes in network structure. Consequently, variation in ecologically-important interactions can be missed. Network motifs are a way to characterise network structure that is substantially more sensitive to changes in pairwise interactions and is gaining in popularity. However, there is no software available in R, the most popular programming language among ecologists, for conducting motif analyses in bipartite networks. Similarly, no mathematical formalisation of bipartite motifs has been developed. Here we introduce bmotif: a package for motif analyses of bipartite networks. Our code is primarily an r package, but we also provide matlab and Python code of the core functionality. The software is based on a mathematical framework where, for the first time, we derive formal expressions for motif frequencies and the frequencies with which species occur in different positions within motifs. This framework means that analyses with bmotif are fast, making motif methods compatible with the permutational approaches often used in network studies, such as null model analyses. We describe the package and demonstrate how it can be used to conduct ecological analyses, using two examples of plant-pollinator networks. We first use motifs to examine the assembly and disassembly of an Arctic plant-pollinator community and then use them to compare the roles of native and introduced plant species in an unrestored site in Mauritius. bmotif will enable motif analyses of a wide range of bipartite ecological networks, allowing future research to characterise these complex networks without discarding important meso-scale structural detail.","[Simmons, Benno, I; Sweering, Michelle J.

There is mixed evidence from a limited number of studies, however, regarding how predator presence influences settlement of coral-reef fishes and it is unknown how other potentially mediating factors, including predator origin (native vs. nonnative) or interactions among con-specific recruits, mediate the non-consumptive effects of predators on reef fish settlement. During a field experiment in the Caribbean, approximately 52% fewer mahogany snapper (Lutjanus mahogoni) recruited to reefs with a native predator (graysby grouper, Cephalopholis cruentata) than to predator-free control reefs and reefs with an invasive predator (red lionfish, Pterois volitans) regardless of predator diet. These results suggest that snapper recruits do not recognize nonnative lionfish as a threat. However, these effects depended on the density of conspecific recruits, with evidence that competition may limit the response of snapper to even native predators at the highest recruit densities. In contrast, there was no effect of predator presence or conspecific density on the recruitment of bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus). These context-dependent responses of coral- reef fishes to predators during settlement may influence individual survival and shape subsequent population and community dynamics.","[Benkwitt, Cassandra E.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Benkwitt, CE (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",benkwitc@science.oregonstate.edu,,"Benkwitt, Cassandra/0000-0001-6756-7958",National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); American Fisheries Society Steven Berkeley Marine Conservation Fellowship; Oregon State University Research Grants; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-12-33027],"Funding was provided by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship, American Fisheries Society Steven Berkeley Marine Conservation Fellowship, Oregon State University Research Grants, and Sigma Xi Grant-in-Aid of Research awarded to the author, and NSF grant OCE-12-33027 awarded to M.A. Hixon.

We aimed here to identify variation in tree species composition throughout the Ngovayang Massif (southern Cameroon) and determine the relative contributions of environmental factors and spatial autocorrelation in shaping tree species composition. Vegetation surveys were conducted in fifteen 1-ha (100 m x 100 m) permanent plots established along a transect from lowland (200 m) to submontane forests (900 m) in which all trees with a diameter (dbh) >= 10 cm were inventoried. Data were investigated using ordination methods (Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis). At the local scale, the most important variable in determining tree species composition patterns was slope exposure, followed by distance from the ocean and altitude. Together, these environmental variables explained 28% of floristic variation among plots, and the spatial structure almost disappeared when the effects of these variables were removed. Spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that spatial variables (geographic coordinates of the plots) or geographic distance between plots explained only 1% of the total initial variance. Residual spatial variation not explained by the environmental variables probably reflects the history of vegetation and the effects of other climatic variables that were not included in this study. Floristic variation in the Ngovayang Massif is due to strong environmental heterogeneity. The sensitivity of floristic composition to environmental variables such as slope orientation and altitude suggests that tree species composition may shift with expected climate changes, such as changes in the movement of air masses, increase in mean annual temperatures or increasing severity of the dry season. Our study highlights the need for systematic on-the-ground measurements of climate variables in tropical montane areas in order to better understand the current climate regime and serve as a basis for modelling future changes.","[Gonmadje, Christelle] Univ Yaounde I, Dept Plant Biol, POB 812, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Gonmadje, Christelle; Doumenge, Charles] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Forets & Soc, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Sunderland, Terry] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, POB 0113, Bobcd Bogor 16000, Indonesia; [Sunderland, Terry] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [McKey, Doyle] CNRS 5175, UMR, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France","Gonmadje, C (corresponding author), Univ Yaounde I, Dept Plant Biol, POB 812, Yaounde, Cameroon.",cgonmadje@yahoo.fr,"Sunderland, Terence/AAE-7851-2019","Sunderland, Terence/0000-0002-1985-9849",French Ministry of Foreign Affairs [374]; Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement (CIRAD); Service de Cooperation et d'Action Culturelle (SCAC) of the French Embassy in Cameroon,"We thank 'Sud Expert Plantes' (SEP No 374, a programme funded by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs), the Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement (CIRAD), and the Service de Cooperation et d'Action Culturelle (SCAC) of the French Embassy in Cameroon for financial assistance through research grants that made this study possible.

However, great uncertainties exist for the CO2 fertilisation effects, particularly when its interactions with other global change factors are considered. A four-factor (CO2, temperature, precipitation and nitrogen) experiment revealed that elevated CO2 did not affect either gross ecosystem productivity or ecosystem respiration, and consequently resulted in no changes of net ecosystem productivity in a semi-arid grassland despite whether temperature, precipitation and nitrogen were elevated or not. The observations could be primarily attributable to the offset of ecosystem carbon uptake by enhanced soil carbon release under CO2 enrichment. Our findings indicate that arid and semi-arid ecosystems may not be sensitive to CO2 enrichment as previously expected and highlight the urgent need to incorporate this mechanism into most IPCC carbon-cycle models for convincing projection of terrestrial carbon sink and its feedback to climate change.","[Song, Jian; Wan, Shiqiang; Liu, Yinzhan; Zhong, Mingxing; Zheng, Mengmei; Ma, Gaigai; Zhou, Zhenxing; Ru, Jingyi] Henan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Int Joint Res Lab Global Change Ecol, Kaifeng 475004, Henan, Peoples R China; [Song, Jian; Wan, Shiqiang] Hebei Univ, Coll Life Sci, Baoding 071002, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sinofrench Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Earth Sci, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Hui, Dafeng] Tennessee State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37209 USA; [Hovenden, Mark J.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Biol Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Ciais, Philippe] UVSQ, CNRS, CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Liu, Yongwen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Wan, SQ (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Int Joint Res Lab Global Change Ecol, Kaifeng 475004, Henan, Peoples R China.; Wan, SQ (corresponding author), Hebei Univ, Coll Life Sci, Baoding 071002, Hebei, Peoples R China.",swan@ibcas.ac.cn,"Ciais, Philippe M/A-6840-2011; ������, ������������/X-2681-2019; Liu, Yinzhan/AAC-2391-2021; Wan, Shiqiang/L-9166-2019; Zhou, Zhenxing/ABA-2159-2020; Wan, Shiqiang/B-5799-2009; Liu, Yongwen/O-7330-2015","Ciais, Philippe M/0000-0001-8560-4943; Zhou, Zhenxing/0000-0001-9208-0893; Wan, Shiqiang/0000-0003-0631-1232; Liu, Yongwen/0000-0002-9664-303X; Hui, Dafeng/0000-0002-5284-2897","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31430015, 31830012, 41030104/D0308]","The authors thank Juanjuan Han for her constructive suggestions in improving the manuscript, Haijun Yang, Tingjuan Wu, Qian Zhang, Pengshuai Shao, Fanglong Su, Yuan Miao, Hongyan Han, Ang Zhang, Tong Zhang, Jiajia Wang, Jiajia Zhang, and Guoyong Li for their help in the experiment construction and data measurements, and the staff at the Duolun Restoration Ecology Research Station, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for their help in maintaining the field facilities.

Standardized protocols are urgently needed, alongside a better understanding of how different methods and recorders (data collectors) influence estimates of pollinator abundance and diversity. We compared two common methods for sampling wild pollinating insects (solitary bees, bumblebees and hoverflies), pan traps and transects, in surveys of 1 km countryside squares (agricultural and semi-natural habitats) and flowering crop fields across Great Britain, including the influence of local floral resources (nectar sugar availability or crop flower density) on the insects sampled. Further, we compared the performance of recorders with differing expertise (non-specialist research staff, taxonomic experts and non-expert volunteers) in applying methods. Pan traps and transects produced compositionally distinct samples of pollinator communities. In the wider countryside, pan traps sampled more species of solitary bee and hoverfly. In flowering crops, transects recorded a greater number of individual bumblebees, but fewer species. Across all taxonomic groups and countryside and crop samples, transects generally had lower rates of species accumulation per individual collected than pan traps. This demonstrates that differences between methods in estimating richness are not due to sampling effort alone. However, recorders possessing greater taxonomic expertise can produce species accumulation data from transects that are almost commensurate with pan trapping. The abundance and species richness of pollinators (except solitary bees) on transects in the wider countryside was positively related to the availability of estimated nectar sugar. In crops, pollinator abundance responses to flower densities were idiosyncratic according to crop type, but overall the response was positive and negative for transects and pan traps, respectively. Given these taxonomic and context-specific differences in method performance, we assess their suitability for monitoring pollinating insect communities and pollination services. We discuss the relevance of these findings within the context of achieving standardized, large-scale monitoring of pollinating insects.","[O'Connor, Rory S.; Garratt, Michael P.

The study was conducted in Limu Seka district, south-west Ethiopia. Faecal analysis was employed to assess the diet spectrum, seasonal abundance and relative importance of food items. Over 55 different food items were identified from the analysis of 387 scat samples collected during the dry and wet seasons. In the coffee forest habitat, African civets showed omnivorous feeding habit with plant-to-animal diet biomass ratio of 1:1.36. A slight diet specialization was observed during the wet season (BA=0.46) favouring animal prey. However, during the dry season, they showed generalist feeding habit (BA=0.87) with more plant biomass in their diet. With over 64% occurrence and 14.4% biomass, coffee berries significantly contributed to the civets dry season plant diets. The excreted coffee beans, after civets ingested ripe coffee berries, are the tastiest product used by farmers for consumption and market. Seasonal collection of civet coffee from coffee forest floor economically supports the farmers while increasing the importance of civets in the habitat and hence contributing for its conservation.","[Habtamu, Tadesse] Mettu Univ, Dept Biol, Mettu 318, Ethiopia; [Bekele, Afework] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Zool Sci, Addis Ababa 1176, Ethiopia; [Ahmed, Raya] Jimma Agr Mech Res Ctr, Jimma 256, Ethiopia; [Gadisa, Tsegaye] Jimma Univ, Dept Biol, Jimma 378, Ethiopia; [Birlie, Belay] Jimma Univ, Dept Stat, Jimma 378, Ethiopia; [Tolemariam, Taye; Belay, Berhanu] Jimma Univ, Coll Agr & Vet Med, Jimma 378, Ethiopia","Habtamu, T (corresponding author), Mettu Univ, Dept Biol, Mettu 318, Ethiopia.",habtamu_tadese@yahoo.com,,"Birlie, Belay/0000-0001-8621-6539","Animal Diversity Thematic Research, Addis Ababa University","We sincerely thank the Animal Diversity Thematic Research, Addis Ababa University, for funding the research and Jimma University for the laboratory facilities.

Recent advances in spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models have provided new approaches for monitoring trends in wildlife abundance and these methods are particularly applicable to large carnivores. We applied SCR models in a Bayesian framework to estimate mountain lion densities in the Bitterroot Mountains of west central Montana. We incorporate an existing resource selection function (RSF) as a density covariate to account for heterogeneity in habitat use across the study area and include data collected from harvested lions. We identify individuals through DNA samples collected by (1) biopsy darting mountain lions detected in systematic surveys of the study area, (2) opportunistically collecting hair and scat samples, and (3) sampling all harvested mountain lions. We included 80 DNA samples collected from 62 individuals in the analysis. Including information on predicted habitat use as a covariate on the distribution of activity centers reduced the median estimated density by 44%, the standard deviation by 7%, and the width of 95% credible intervals by 10% as compared to standard SCR models. Within the two management units of interest, we estimated a median mountain lion density of 4.5 mountain lions/100 km 2 (95% CI = 2.9, 7.7) and 5.2 mountain lions/100 km(2) (95% CI = 3.4, 9.1). Including harvested individuals (dead recovery) did not create a significant bias in the detection process by introducing individuals that could not be detected after removal. However, the dead recovery component of the model did have a substantial effect on results by increasing sample size. The ability to account for heterogeneity in habitat use provides a useful extension to SCR models, and will enhance the ability of wildlife managers to reliably and economically estimate density of wildlife populations, particularly large carnivores.","[Proffitt, K.

I tested the hypothesis that successional changes in vegetation structure, which affected invertebrate abundance, would influence growth rates and body condition in the early-successional, insectivorous gecko Nephrurus stellatus. I captured geckos at 17 woodland sites spanning a succession gradient from 2 to 48 years post-fire. Body condition and growth rates were analysed as a function of the best-fitting fire-related predictor (invertebrate abundance or time since fire) with different combinations of the co-variates age, sex and location. Body condition in the whole population was positively affected by increasing invertebrate abundance and, in the adult population, this effect was most pronounced for females. There was strong support for a decline in growth rates in weight with time since fire. The results suggest that increased early-successional invertebrate abundance has filtered through to a higher trophic level with physiological benefits for insectivorous geckos. I integrated the new findings about trophic interactions into a general conceptual model of mechanisms underlying post-fire population dynamics based on a long-term research programme. The model highlights how greater food availability during early succession could drive rapid population growth by contributing to previously reported enhanced reproduction and dispersal. This study provides a framework to understand links between ecological and physiological traits underlying post-fire population dynamics.","[Smith, Annabel L.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland","Smith, AL (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland.",annabel@smithecology.org,"Smith, Annabel L./M-6391-2014","Smith, Annabel L./0000-0002-1201-8713",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP0776604]; Native Vegetation Council of South Australia; DEWNR; Wildlife Conservation Fund; Sir Mark Mitchell Research Foundation; Lirabenda Endowment Fund; Ecological Society of Australia; Australian National UniversityAustralian National University,"This paper is dedicated to the memory of Professor C.

However, its application to wetlands has sometimes been flawed with uncertainties and unrecognized errors, to a large extent due to the inherent and specific ecological characteristics of Mediterranean wetlands. We present here an overview of the state of the art on RS techniques for mapping and monitoring Mediterranean wetlands, and the remaining challenges: delineating and separating wetland habitat types; mapping water dynamics inside wetlands; and detecting actual wetland trends over time in a context of high, natural variability. The most important lessons learned are that ecologists' knowledge need to be integrated with RS expertise to achieve a valuable monitoring approach of these ecosystems.","[Perennou, Christian; Guelmami, Anis; Poulin, Brigitte; Geijzendorffer, Ilse R.] Res Inst Conservat Mediterranean Wetlands, Tour du Valat, Arles, France; [Paganini, Marc] European Space Agcy, Frascati, Italy; [Philipson, Petra] Brockmann Geomat Sweden AB, Stockholm, Sweden; [Strauch, Adrian] Univ Bonn, Ctr Remote Sensing Land Surfaces ZFL, Bonn, Germany; [Tottrup, Christian] DHI GRAS, Horsholm, Denmark; [Truckenbrodt, John] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Geog, Jena, Germany","Perennou, C (corresponding author), Res Inst Conservat Mediterranean Wetlands, Tour du Valat, Arles, France.",perennou@tourduvalat.org,"Truckenbrodt, John/U-8432-2019","Truckenbrodt, John/0000-0002-7259-101X; Geijzendorffer, Ilse R./0000-0002-8471-7695; Strauch, Adrian/0000-0001-9309-1543; Tottrup, Christian/0000-0002-4937-0083",,,,85,23,25,1,22,ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0065-2504,2163-582X,978-0-12-813949-3,ADV ECOL RES,Adv.

Understanding habitat preference of a targeted wildlife species is crucial for developing effective conservation strategies. Habitat preference of large grazers in connection to grass height and post-fire effect has been debated for the last century. Here, we examined the effects of season, grass height and burning on the habitat preference on Swayne's hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus swaynei) in Maze National Park. Data for seasonal habitat selection were collected using both direct observation along established transect lines and pellet counting using permanently established plots. Every month, we measured grass height commonly preferred by Swayne's hartebeest in grassland habitat. Starting from the first week of burning, we recorded the abundance of Swayne's hartebeest in both burned and unburned grassland patches. Results From detected pellets, 94.3% were recorded in the grassland habitat indicating that other habitat types are less used despite their extensive cover > 50% of the Park. During wet and early dry seasons, Swayne's hartebeest exclusively preferred grassland habitat. We found that 85.2% (n = 1079) and 85.3% (n = 593) of individuals observed in areas with a grass height below 30 cm during wet and early-dry seasons, respectively; while 70.9% (n = 2288) preferred grass height below 30 cm during the dry season. The density of Swayne's hartebeest in burned grassland area was higher than unburned grassland areas up to 150 days since burning. However, in unburned grassland areas, the density was initially low but showed increasing trend for consecutive days, reaching similar density with burned areas after 150 days since burning. Conclusion Swayne's hartebeest exclusively preferred grassland habitat, particularly during wet and early-dry seasons, shortest available grass height in all seasons and were attracted to burned grassland areas. Our results suggested that fire played an important role in maintaining habitat quality in grassland, and that management should continue using controlled burning as a tool for the conservation of Swayne's hartebeest. However, we remain cautious of our findings given the paucity of information regarding other confounding factors and the absence of long-term data on fire disturbance.","[Tamrat, Misganaw; Stenseth, Nils Chr.] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, POB 1066, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Tamrat, Misganaw; Atickem, Anagaw; Bekele, Afework] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Zool Sci, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Tsegaye, Diress] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, POB 1066, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Tsegaye, Diress] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway; [Evangelista, Paul] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, B254 NESB, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA","Tamrat, M (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, POB 1066, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",tamratm15@gmail.com,,,Rufford Small Grant for Nature Conservation [24529-2]; Addis Ababa Uni-versity [TR-010 CNCS],"Rufford (24529-2) Small Grant for Nature Conservation and Addis Ababa Uni-versity (TR-010 CNCS) thematic research project funded this study.

Using three-block partial least squares regression, we present a procedure to quantify and define bi-variance and tri-variance of data blocks related to plant communities, their soil parameters, and topography. Bi-variance indicates the total amount of covariation between these three domains taken in pairs, whereas tri-variance refers to the common variance shared by all domains. We characterized relationships among three domains (plant communities, soil properties, topography) for a salt marsh, four coastal dunes, and two temperate forests spanning several regions in the world. We defined the specific bi- and tri-variances for the ecological systems we included in this study and addressed larger questions about how these variances scale with each other looking at generalities across systems. We show that a system tends to exhibit high bi-variance and tri-variance (tight coupling among domains) when subjected to the effects of frequent and widespread (i.e., broadly acting) hydrogeomorphic disturbance. When major disturbance events are uncommon, bi-variance and tri-variance decrease, because the formation of vegetation, soil, and topographic patterns is primarily localized, and the couplings of these properties diverge over space, contingent upon site-specific disturbance history and/or fine-grained environmental heterogeneity. We also demonstrate that the bi-variance and tri-variance of a whole system are not consistently either greater or smaller than those of the associated sub-zones. This point implies that the overall correlation structure among vegetation, soil, and topography is conserved across spatial scales. This paper addresses a critical aspect of ecology: the conceptual and analytical integration of data across multiple domains. By example, we show that bi-variances and tri-variances provide useful insight into how the strength of couplings among vegetation, soil, and topography data blocks varies across scales and disturbance regimes. Though we describe the simplest case of multi-variance beyond the usual two-block linear statistical model, this approach can be extended to any number of data domains, making integration tractable and more supportive of holistic inferences.","[Kim, Daehyun; Stallins, J.

In this study climatogenic changes in forest growing conditions are examined in the Northern Caspian region, taking into account that the functioning of forest stands is limited on historically treeless lands: authomorphic meliorated solonetz soils and calcisoles (by the extra moisture of winter snowfalls and the humidity levels during the vegetational period), as well as intrazonal hydromorphic gleyic kastanozems of the local relief depressions (by the inexhaustibility of freshwater lenses in salty subterranean waters based on its periodic resupply by the spring surface flow every 2-4 years). For forest stands established on automorphic soils, a prolonged period of annual draughts and mild winters with little snow deposit in forest lands has proven to be the most dangerous. During such periods, the large-scale death of trees is observed and many forest stands are ruined. For forest stands on hydromorphic soils, such periods prove to be just as dangerous because of the 15-year-long absence of spring surface flow. Such a climatogenic scenario of long-termed deterioration of forest growing conditions in the Northern Caspian region is similar to the southernmost regions of Russia that are currently totally unable to sustain forests, with unstable snow cover and frequent draughts.","[Sapanov, M.

However, there have been few comparisons of the effectiveness of different types of field-margin pollinator habitat in maintaining bee diversity and pollination of the focal crops. We compared wild bee abundance, species richness and community composition between strawberry crops bordered by hedgerows, and those bordered by larger expanses of natural land (forests). Strawberry is an ideal crop in which to investigate pollinator export from field margins as the rows are covered with straw, which reduces habitat for ground-nesting bees within the crop; thus, most wild pollinators need to enter the crop from the margins. We sampled bees in six strawberry fields with hedgerow margins and six strawberry fields with forested margins of at least 200 m in length, using a paired design. We examined strawberry pollen deposition at regular intervals into the fields, and the magnitude of pollinator export from the field margins towards the centre of the crops. We found that bees as a group were no more species-rich or abundant in crops bordered by forests than in crops bordered by hedgerows, although large-bodied bees were more abundant in the former than the latter. Regardless of field-margin type, we found that small wild bee abundance declined significantly from the edge to the centre of the crop, but honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) and large-bodied bee abundance did not. Strawberry pollen deposition also did not decline with distance into the crop. Although previous work indicates that small wild bees are more effective (yield-increasing) pollinators of strawberry on a per-visit basis, their limited foraging ranges suggest they may only pollinate areas near the crop margins, given typical field sizes in our area.

Prevalence of infection was low, and we found no conclusive evidence that infection status was linked to particular MHCIIB alleles. Individual-level MHCIIB nucleotide diversity, and the number of alleles per bird were both lower in infected compared with uninfected samples; however, neither trend was statistically significant. Genetic structure was observed in the MHCIIB dataset, suggesting that selective forces are shaping MHCIIB diversity in this population.

However, understanding which antipredator mechanisms are lost through relaxed selection, and how they influence the ability of prey to respond to novel predatory threats, is limited. The varying effects on native lizard populations of the relatively recent and patchy history of mammalian introductions to New Zealand's islands provide an opportunity to examine the consequences of relaxed selection. We assess behavioural patterns and predator detection abilities of native lizards, using chemicals of native reptilian and introduced rodent predators as cues. Focal lizard populations were isolated from predatory mammals for up to 16 million years; some now co-occur with mammals, while others remain in mammal-free locations. A skink species that evolved with mammals and has recently been introduced to New Zealand is included for comparison. Lizard behavioural patterns were correlated with recent and historical experience of mammals. Lizards always isolated from mammals exhibited the most antipredator freeze behaviour, whereas one that coevolved with mammals exhibited greatest activity (movements). However, predator chemical cues did not induce specific antipredator responses in any species indicating that these behavioural patterns are not linked to chemosensory predator detection alone.","[Monks, Joanne M.; Nelson, Nicola J.; Daugherty, Charles H.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Brunton, Dianne H.] Massey Univ, Inst Nat & Math Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Shine, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Monks, Joanne M.] Dept Conservat, Biodivers Grp, POB 5244, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Shine, Richard] Macquarie Univ, Sch Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW, Australia","Monks, JM (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand.; Monks, JM (corresponding author), Dept Conservat, Biodivers Grp, POB 5244, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",jmonks@doc.govt.nz,,,"Foundation for Research, Science TechnologyNew Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology; Society for Research on Amphibians and Reptiles in New Zealand; Zoological Society of San Diego; Ngati Koata; Te Atiawa; Ngati Toa iwi","We thank Peter Martin, Richard Romijn, Rhys Mills, Jo Peace, Grant Timlin, James Allen and Jen Moore for assistance.

The literature describes the use of the multisubstrate testing system (MTS) Ecolog for the solution of environmental problems. It is based on triphenyltetrazolium bromide, which has proven itself in assessing the negative consequences in the environment due to industrial and domestic pollution. In environmental studies, the viability of microorganisms and their communities is estimated in terms of the intensity of the restoration of tetrazolium salts, but the authors themselves note that MTS Ecolog does not register the response of the entire microbial community. In connection with this, the purpose of the work was to search for an additional factor for the use of tetrazolium salts, namely, transport them into the cell. The identification of the role of diffusion in the cellular formation of formazanes plays an important role in increasing the objectivity of research results, including ecological ones, with the participation of tetrazolium salts. Using the kinetic methods, the role of passive diffusion in the reduction of iodnitrotetrazolium (INT) by cells of gramnegative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli is shown. Applying the integral method of determining the general order, it is found that the reduction of INT by cell components of bacteria Ps. aeruginosa, suspended in physiological solution, is satisfactorily described by linear anamorphosis of the first order kinetics. It has been established that the reduction of iodnitrotetrazolium chloride by the cellular components of bacteria depends on the structure and chemical composition of the cell wall and biomembranes of bacteria and is controlled by the diffusion of the reagent into the cell. The linear dependence of the initial rate of reduction of INT from its initial concentration was revealed, which for biological objects involving cells is a sign of passive diffusion. A low temperature sensitivity of the reduction reaction of the INT is detected in the temperature range, which does not significantly exceed the optimum temperature for Ps. aeruginosa of 37 degrees C.","[Kalinina, A.

Recent field studies have shown that such predator nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) can ultimately affect prey demography. The environment is known to modulate predator consumptive effects on prey demography, but the environmental modulation of predator NCEs on prey demography remains unstudied. We investigated this knowledge gap using an intertidal predator-prey system. Dogwhelk (Nucella lapillus) chemical cues can limit barnacle (Semibalanus balanoides) recruitment by limiting larval settlement. As waves disperse chemicals in coastal environments, we experimentally tested the hypothesis that wave exposure limits dogwhelk NCEs on barnacle recruitment. Shortly before the barnacle recruitment season of 2013 (May-June), we established cages in rocky intertidal habitats in Atlantic Canada under two levels of wave exposure. The cages were used to manipulate the presence and absence of dogwhelks. At the center of each cage, we installed a tile where barnacle pelagic larvae could settle and develop into recruits. Mesh prevented caged dogwhelks from accessing the tiles, but allowed their waterborne cues to reach the tiles. Data collected at the end of the recruitment season indicated that dogwhelk cues limited barnacle recruitment in wave-sheltered habitats but had no effect on recruitment in wave-exposed habitats. These findings suggest that predicting predator NCEs on prey demography may require environmental information related to the ability of prey to locate predators.","[Ellrich, Julius A.; Scrosati, Ricardo A.] St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, 2320 Notre Dame Ave, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada","Scrosati, RA (corresponding author), St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, 2320 Notre Dame Ave, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada.",rscrosat@stfx.ca,"Scrosati, Ricardo A/K-6172-2016","Scrosati, Ricardo A/0000-0002-3050-132X; Ellrich, Julius/0000-0003-0884-3726","Canada Research Chairs Program (CRC)Canada Research ChairsAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme; Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI)Canada Foundation for Innovation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","We thank Katharina Romoth, Lorena Arribas, and Willy Petzold for field assistance, David Risk, Steven MacDonald, and Vince Arsenault for laboratory assistance, and Markus Molis, Russell Wyeth, and an anonymous reviewer for constructive comments.

Because of their worldwide distribution, we focused on the common pillbug Armadillidium vulgare (Latreille, 1804) (Isopoda, Armadillidiidae), and the common millipede species Rossiulus kessleri (Lohmander, 1927) (Julida, Julidae). The function of environment creation by the given saprophages, as destructors of dead plant matter, supporting such ecosystem services as soil fertility improvement and nutrients' turnover, is highlighted. To conduct the experiment, the animals were collected manually and using pitfall trapping. In order to bring the experimental conditions closer to the natural, the individuals were not sexed. The maximum consumption of leaf litter by woodlice was recorded in the conditions with adequate moisture (0.5 mL of distilled water per box) and amounted to 2.52 mg/10 individuals per day, which exceeds its consumption with low and increased moisture, respectively, by 1.82 and 1.24 times. As for the effect of interaction, the consumption of maple litter with optimal moisture (4.77 mg/10 individuals per day) was the greatest. The largest absolute difference between broad-leaved tree species in the average weight of leaf litter consumed by woodlice was between maple leaf litter and oak leaf litter, the minimum - between robinia leaf litter and oak leaf litter. According to the results of the obtained data (Diplopoda), it can be stated that there is a statistically significant effect of chemical stress and discrepancy of the average zinc content in the object of study (in Diplopoda and their faecal pellets). We found that the diet provided did not affect the distribution of zinc in Diplopoda under conditions of chemical stress. According to the results of pairwise comparisons, we determined that the zinc content in the Diplopoda clearly differs for control and almost every concentration of zinc sulfate solution - 0.03 and 0.15 g/L, the samples of which do not form a homogeneous group. The species composition, abundance and distribution in space of soil invertebrates are informative indicators which reflect the ecological state of soils, intensity in development of soil horizons as well as intensity of processes occurring in them.","[Pokhylenko, A.

Therefore, it is crucial to assess the relative importance of deterministic vs. stochastic factors producing remnant vegetation to understand their function in the persistence of fire-sensitive plants. Vegetation remnants (areas within the landscape that have not burned for a considerable amount of time) may occur stochastically or in more predictable locations (fire refuges) where physical conditions decrease fire severity. Our aim was to determine if remnant forests of the fire-sensitive conifer Austrocedrus chilensis are associated with biophysical attributes that allow persistence in a fire-prone Patagonian landscape. We conducted a multi-scale approach, determining attributes of forest remnants and their surroundings (matrices) through remote sensing and field-based biophysical and functional characteristics, and quantifying how tree survival probability relates to microsite conditions. Trees within remnants displayed abundant fire scars, were twofold older and had threefold larger growth rates than matrix trees. Remnants were associated with high rocky cover and elevated topographical positions. Tree survival increased in hilltops, eastern aspects, and with sparse vegetation. Trees within remnants experienced severe reductions in growth during droughts. Our results suggest that A. chilensis remnants are mainly the result of refuges, where environmental conditions increase fire survival, but also increase susceptibility to drought. A trade-off between fire survival and drought vulnerability may imply that under increasing drought and fire severity, locations that in the past have served as refuges may reduce their ability to allow the persistence of fire-sensitive taxa.","[Landesmann, Jennifer B.; Gowda, Juan H.; Kitzberger, Thomas] Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Lab Ecotono, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Garibaldi, Lucas A.] UNRN, CONICET, Sede Andina, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Landesmann, JB (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Lab Ecotono, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",jennifer.landesmann@gmail.com,"Garibaldi, Lucas A/D-7302-2013; Gowda, Juan/ABE-6184-2020; Kitzberger, Thomas/H-9209-2015","Gowda, Juan/0000-0001-5481-3793; Kitzberger, Thomas/0000-0002-9754-4121; Garibaldi, Lucas Alejandro/0000-0003-0725-4049","Ministerio de Agricultura, Ganaderia y Pesca [BIRF 7520, PIA 10058, PIA 12055]; CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)","We thank Juan Manuel Morales for insightful comments on the manuscript and Maria Laura Suarez for her help in the tree chronology and correlation function analysis.

Snake venoms, in particular, have evolved a wide diversity of peptides and proteins that induce harmful inflammatory and neurotoxic effects including severe pain and paralysis, hemotoxic effects, such as hemorrhage and coagulopathy, and cytotoxic/myotoxic effects, such as inflammation and necrosis. If untreated, many envenomings result in death or severe morbidity in humans and, despite advances in management, snakebite remains a major public health problem, particularly in developing countries. Consequently, the World Health Organization recently recognized snakebite as a neglected tropical disease that affects similar to 2.7 million p.a. The major protein classes found in snake venoms are phospholipases, metalloproteases, serine proteases, and three-finger peptides. The mechanisms of action and pharmacological properties of many snake venom toxins have been elucidated, revealing a complex multifunctional cocktail that can act synergistically to rapidly immobilize prey and deter predators. However, despite these advances many snake toxins remain to be structurally and pharmacologically characterized. In this review, the multifunctional features of the peptides and proteins found in snake venoms, as well as their evolutionary histories, are discussed with the view to identifying novel modes of action and improving snakebite treatments.","[Ferraz, Camila R.; Lewis, Richard J.; Cardoso, Fernanda C.] Univ Queensland, Inst Mol Biosci, Ctr Pain Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Ferraz, Camila R.] Univ Estadual Londrina, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Dept Ciencias Patol, Londrina, Brazil; [Arrahman, Arif; Xie, Chunfang; Kool, Jeroen] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Mol Med & Syst, Div BioAnalyt Chem, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Casewell, Nicholas R.] Univ Liverpool Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Ctr Snakebite Res & Intervent, Liverpool, Merseyside, England","Cardoso, FC (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Inst Mol Biosci, Ctr Pain Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",f.caldascardoso@uq.edu.au,"Lewis, Richard/E-8674-2013","Lewis, Richard/0000-0003-3470-923X",Australian National Health and Medical Research CouncilNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [APP1119056]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [200517/Z/16/Z]; Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission [200517/Z/16/Z],Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (APP1119056) provided a Fellowship to RL; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) provided an international scholarship to CF; Sir Henry Dale Fellowship to NC (200517/Z/16/Z) funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society.,,197,32,33,1,9,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Cultivation improves the supply of plant materials and minimizes revegetation costs, but can also favor agronomic traits, and resulting vigor may affect the competitive ability and long-term persistence of cultivated genotypes at restoration sites. We compared cultivated, restored, and wild populations of Pascopyrum smithii (western wheatgrass) in a greenhouse study to test the extent to which cultivars outcompete local plants in biomass production, and to determine if morphological differences (including height and number of leaves) among cultivated and wild populations persist at restoration sites over time. We found evidence of vigor and greater competitive ability of cultivars in seed mass, growth rate, plant height, and biomass and this advantage occurred when plants were grown alone or in competition with other seed sources. Cultivar vigor persisted at restoration sites over 30 years, but restored populations more closely resembled wild, local populations when cultivars were planted in closer proximity to nearby undisturbed sites.

A small number of hyperdiverse genera comprise a large portion of tree diversity in tropical forests. These closely related congeners are likely to share natural enemies. Diverse defenses could still allow congeners to partition niche space defined by natural enemies, but interspecific differences in defenses would have to exceed intraspecific variation in defenses. We ask whether interspecific variation in secondary chemistry exceeds intraspecific variation for species from four hyperdiverse tropical tree genera. We used novel methods to quantify chemical structural similarity for all compounds present in methanol extracts of leaf tissue. We sought to maximize intraspecific variation by selecting conspecific leaves from different ontogenetic stages (expanding immature vs. fully hardened mature), different light environments (deep under-story shade vs. large forest gaps), and different seasons (dry vs. wet). Chemical structural similarity differed with ontogeny, light environment, and season, but interspecific differences including those among congeneric species were much larger. Our results suggest that species differences in secondary chemistry are large relative to within-species variation, perhaps sufficiently large to permit niche segregation among congeneric tree species based on chemical defenses.","[Sedio, Brian E.; Wright, S.

The pastoral industry was identified as one of the key stakeholder groups to work with under the Australian Feral Camel Management Project. The impacts of feral camels fall into three main categories: economic, environmental and social/cultural. It should be noted that not all pastoralists were impacted by feral camels. Under the Australian Feral Camel Management Project, multiple approaches were used to engage the pastoral industry through their involvement in developing partnerships, operational planning, implementation and communication. Critical to the success of the project was the commitment to effectively consult with landholders, build partnerships, respect landholder values, establish effective project governance and adopt a flexible management approach.","[Digby, Donna; Edwards, Glenn] Dept Land Resource Management, POB 1120, Alice Springs, NT 0871, Australia; [Bird, Liz] Indiana Stn, POB 8045, Alice Springs, NT 0871, Australia; [Severin, Lyndee] Curtin Springs Stn, Via Alice Springs, Alice Springs, NT 0871, Australia; [O'Leary, Paul] Dept Primary Ind & Res South Australia, GPO Box 822, Clare, SA 5453, Australia; [O'Leary, Paul] Heli Farm, POB 110, Watervale, SA 5453, Australia; [Jensen, Mac] Dept Agr & Food, POB 417, Kalgoorlie, WA 6430, Australia; [Mills, Robin] Warrawagine Stn, POB 419, Port Hedland, WA 6721, Australia","Digby, D (corresponding author), Dept Land Resource Management, POB 1120, Alice Springs, NT 0871, Australia.",donna.digby@nt.gov.au,,,Australian GovernmentAustralian GovernmentCGIAR; Ninti One,The papers in this special edition are based on work undertaken through the Australian Feral Camel Management Project (2009-2013) that was supported by the Australian Government and other project partners and coordinated by Ninti One.

We tested the hypothesis that an initial shrub encroachment leads to enhanced habitat heterogeneity and thereby to a higher diversity. In a calcareous grassland near Gottingen (Germany) we analysed the effect of shrub encroachment on the species richness in 30, 100 m(2) plots each with 10 subplots of 1m(2) size. The 30 main plots belonged to six different shrub encroachment classes. A descriptive correlative gradient analysis of shrub invaded grasslands and their species number of flowering plants was performed. Within the 30 plots of different shrub encroachment a total of 203 plant species were recorded. The mean alpha 1-diversity (level of subplots), mean alpha 2-diversity (level of plots) as well as the alpha 3-diversity (level of shrub encroachment classes) have their highest values at medium shrub invaded sites. This finding is in line with our hypothesis of a hump-back relation between shrub encroachment and species richness, and can be explained by the increased habitat heterogeneity. However, Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) emphasized the importance of the present vegetation composition for species richness. The dominance of highly competitive, clonal-growing grass species is accompanied by low diversity swards with a lower facilitation of shrub establishment. Species accumulation curves highlight the benefit of shrub encroachment for gamma-(landscape-) diversity. This result emphasises the importance of habitat heterogeneity for biodiversity and, therefore, nature conservation.","[Kesting, S.; Petersen, U.; Isselstein, J.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Von Siebold Str 8, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Kesting, S.] Saxon State Off Environm Agr & Geol, Dept Plant Prod, D-08543 Pohl, Germany; [Petersen, U.] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst Climate Smart Ag, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany","Petersen, U (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Von Siebold Str 8, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany.",Petersen@gmx.net,,,,,,40,10,10,1,34,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",1585-8553,1588-2756,,COMMUNITY ECOL,Community Ecol.,DEC,2015,16,2,,,,,189,195,,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DC7VP,,,Green Accepted,,,9/23/21,

However, there is opposing evidence on whether the secondary compounds of non-native plant species are stronger than those of natives. This may be explained by other factors, besides plant origin, that affect the potential of plant secondary compounds. We tested how plant origin, phylogeny, growth strategy and stoichiometry affected the allelopathic potential of 34 aquatic plants. The allelopathic potential was quantified using bioassays with the cyanobacterium Dolichospermum flos-aquae. The allelopathic potential showed a strong phylogenetic signal, but was similar for native and non-native species. Growth strategy was important, and emergent plants had twice the allelopathic potential as compared to submerged plants. Furthermore, the allelopathic potential was positively correlated to the foliar carbon-to-phosphorus (C:P) and total phenolic content. We conclude that eudicot plant species with an emergent growth strategy and high plant C:P ratio exhibit a high allelopathic potential. Unless non-native plant species match this profile, they generally have a similar allelopathic potential as natives.","[Grutters, Bart M.

In order to improve the modeling of the contaminant concentrations, it is proposed to first process the data using the Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method from HI-IT to obtain a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) which can then be modeled separately using either autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models expanded with a seasonal term, or linear regression analysis, depending on the nature of the IMF. Three priority contaminants measured at Niagara-on-the-Lakes are selected for this study. It is found that the trend of fluoranthene concentrations from April of 1986 to March of 1997 is decreasing and then beginning to increase; the 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene concentrations are decreasing; while the dieldrin concentrations are decreasing. With HHT, appropriate time series models can be identified and constructed for the studied contaminant concentrations to better illustrate the variability of each IMF (and thus the contaminant concentrations) for the studied period. For all data sets modeled in this study, pre-processing the data with HHT allowed for higher R-2 values, correlation coefficients and lower sum of squared errors when compared to modeling without HHT. It is thus confirmed that pre-processing the data with HHT and modeling with time series analysis will provide a more effective means of the studied data sets when identifying and analyzing the trends and variability of studied contaminant concentrations in the Niagara River.","[Tsai, Christina W.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan; [Treadwell, Huntington] SUNY Buffalo, Civil Struct & Environm Engn, 207 Jarvis Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Tsai, Christina W.] SUNY Buffalo, Civil Struct & Environm Engn, 223 Jarvis Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA","Tsai, CW (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.",cwstsai@ntu.edu.tw; hrt@buffalo.edu,,"Tsai, Christina/0000-0003-2309-6335",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-0748787],The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from National Science Foundation under grant contract number EAR-0748787.

Therefore, the aims of this study were to describe the stand and shrub structure of P. cembra forests, compare their structure with the Picea abies forests and analyse differences between silicate and calcicolous P. cembra forests in the Tatra Mts. The data were collected on the 16 sampling plots (500 m(2)), in the Swiss stone pine and Norway spruce forests. We measured the diameter at breast height (dbh) of each tree and recorded the young trees and shrubs. In order to compare species composition between silicate and calcicolous P. cembra forests, we made 91 releves in their entire range of distribution (917 ha). Furthermore, we examined the share of main tree species along the altitude and inclination gradients, using the GAM models. The tree density in the P. cembra forests reaches 618 stems per ha, whereas their basal area (BA) 23.17 m(2) ha(-1). Main tree species are P. cembra and P abies. P. cembra dominates in the higher thickness classes. The BA and dbh structure varies significantly between P. cembra and P. abies forests. The most abundant juveniles are P. abies and Sorbus aucuparia. The differences between forests growing on different substrate are relatively low. The altitude has a significant impact on the share of P. cembra (increase) and P. abies (decrease). The inclination has a significant impact on the increase of share of P. cembra.","[Zieba, Antoni] Tatra Natl Pk, Ul Kuznice 1, PL-34500 Zakopane, Poland; [Zieba, Antoni; Rozanski, Wojciech; Szwagrzyk, Jerzy] Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Forest Biodivers, Al 29 Listopada 46, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland","Zieba, A (corresponding author), Tatra Natl Pk, Ul Kuznice 1, PL-34500 Zakopane, Poland.; Zieba, A (corresponding author), Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Forest Biodivers, Al 29 Listopada 46, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland.",azieba@tpn.pl,,,,,,61,1,1,1,3,POLISH ACAD SCIENCES INST ECOLOGY,LOMIANKI,"DZIEKANOW LESNY NEAR WARSAW, 05-092 LOMIANKI, POLAND",1505-2249,,,POL J ECOL,Pol.

Within this framework, it is suggested that governments and regions should maintain a certain ratio of the area of permanent grasslands to the total Utilized Agricultural Area according to the greening rules of the reform. However, the weak economic performance of permanent grasslands does not encourage farmers to invest into their conservation. This fact persuaded us to revisit our old unpublished data, obtained by experiments on the use of chemical fertilizers in permanent grasslands. By this reanalysis we hope to further support the new European policy with the perspective to find a trade-off between the conservation of the biodiversity and the economic productivity of permanent grasslands. Of the many possibilities we have chosen to present the results of two experiments, one in Italy and the other in Slovakia. The main reason for this choice was that these two studies followed complementary strategies of fertilization that appeared useful to detect both the single and the synergistic effects of N, P, and K on the relationships between yield and species diversity. The results of cluster and diversity analysis suggest that chemical fertilization should be carefully planned according to soil conditions, since different treatments may have the same effect on the floristic and vegetation patterns of grasslands. These results, according to similarity theory, allow to choose the least expensive and polluting combination of N, P and K from those that, according to the species combinations, are assigned to the same cluster.","[Kizekova, M.] Natl Agr & Food Ctr, Grassland & Mt Agr Res Inst, Mladeznicka 36, Banska Bystrica 97421, Slovakia; [Feoli, E.] Univ Trieste, Dept Life Sci, Via A Valerio 10, I-34100 Trieste, Italy; [Parente, G.] European Grassland Federat, Via Adamello 27, I-33078 San Vito Al Taglto, Pordenone, Italy; [Kanianska, R.] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Nat Sci, Tajovskeho 40, Banska Bystrica 97401, Slovakia","Feoli, E (corresponding author), Univ Trieste, Dept Life Sci, Via A Valerio 10, I-34100 Trieste, Italy.",feoli@units.it,"Kanianska, Radoslava/A-9325-2019; Kizekova, Miriam/P-5232-2019","Kanianska, Radoslava/0000-0003-1729-8846; Kizekova, Miriam/0000-0003-3025-6704",,,,56,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1585-8553,1588-2756,,COMMUNITY ECOL,Community Ecol.,DEC,2017,18,3,,,,,295,304,,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FV9BY,,,Green Accepted,,,9/23/21,

We have observed that variations in phytoplankton concentrations in the water over the intertidal zone varied with surf-zone hydrodynamics and we hypothesized that this variation would alter growth rates, population structure, and reproductive output of Mytilus californianus and Balanus glandula. From May 2016 to April 2017, along 7 km of Cape Arago, Oregon, USA surf-zone phytoplankton concentrations were determined weekly at nine sites with varying surf-zone hydrodynamics as indicated by surf-zone widths. Throughout the year, concentrations of phytoplankton in wider, more dissipative surf zones were, on average, 16x higher than in narrow, more reflective surf zones. Similar to previous observations, surf-zone width explained >90% of the variability in phytoplankton concentrations in the surf-zone. On average, similar to 83% of B. glandula had egg lamellae at more dissipative shores compared to only 8% at more reflective. An index of potential reproductive output by barnacle populations as measured by ash free dry mass (AFDM) of egg lamellae was similar to 243x larger at more dissipative than at reflective shores and surf-zone phytoplankton concentrations and surf-zone width explained similar to 96 and 92% of the variability in this index. On average, density of M. californianus was similar to 2x higher at more reflective shores, but 60% of these individuals were smaller and non-reproductive compared to only 24% at the more dissipative sites. The gonad tissue mass/m(2) of medium sized mussels was similar to 5x greater at more dissipative than reflective shores. Surf-zone phytoplankton concentrations and surf-zone width explained similar to 80% and 65% of the variability in individual mussel gonad mass and similar to 69% and 56% of the variability in mussel population gonad mass, respectively. M. californianus were out-planted to assess growth rates and, after 5 months, average body mass was similar to 3x greater at more dissipative than reflective shores. Surf-zone phytoplankton concentrations and width explained similar to 85% and 92% of the mass increase, respectively.

Salix sachalinensis was by far the most preferred host plant of feeding adults, while both S. miyabeana and S. integra were rarely fed upon. The fact that most oviposition was observed on S. sachalinensis also suggested that P. versicolora preferred S. sachalinensis to other willows for oviposition. This adult preference did not correspond well to patterns of larval performance on the three willow species in the absence of enemies. Higher survivorship, shorter developmental time and larger adult size were achieved on S. sachalinensis and S. miyabeana than on S. integra. Performance as indicated by female adult size and development time on S. miyabeana were higher than on S. sachalinensis. In the presence of enemies, however, the survivorship of first-instar larvae on S. miyabeana was much lower than on other willows. Adults of P. versicolora apparently avoided S. miyabeana as an oviposition and feeding host and preferred S. sachalinensis as an enemy-free space. This was not because larvae had poorer performance on S. miyabeana, but because predation pressure on eggs and early instar larvae was more severe on S. miyabeana.","[Ishihara, Michihiro; Ohgushi, Takayuki] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Ishihara, Michihiro] Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Naka Ku, Sakai, Osaka 5998531, Japan","Ishihara, M (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.",mishiha@b.s.osakafu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,67,13,14,0,22,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

However, few Australian studies have been undertaken which specifically address the effects of commercial management regimes on rice field biodiversity. In this study, we compared aquatic macroinvertebrate communities within Australian rice fields cultivated under three commercial management regimes: conventional-aerial (agrochemicals applied, aerially sown), conventional-drill (agrochemicals applied, directly drill-sown) and organic-drill (agrochemical-free, directly drill-sown). These comparisons were undertaken using a combination of community assessment approaches, including morphospecies richness, abundance, diversity and community composition. In general, greater biodiversity existed within macroinvertebrate communities that developed under organic management regimes than under conventional regimes (i.e., higher morphospecies richness and Shannon diversity). Although there were significant differences in several parameters across management regimes early in the rice-growing season, as the growing season progressed the invertebrate communities that developed in the different management regimes became more similar. Only community composition analyses showed significant differences late in the growing season, with functional differences across aquatic faunal assemblages suggested by increased predator abundance in communities sampled from the organic management regime. In order to improve biodiversity within these aquatic environments, management techniques need to be examined individually and the most disruptive processes identified. Alternative management procedures can then be developed that minimise biodiversity loss whilst still delivering required agronomic outcomes.","[Wilson, A. L.; Watts, R.

However, delineating and mapping hotspots is subjective and various approaches can lead to different conclusions with regard to the classification of particular areas as hotspots, complicating long-term conservation planning. We present a comparative analysis of recent approaches for identifying waterbird hotspots, with the goal of developing insights about the appropriate use of these methods. We selected four commonly used measures to identify persistent areas of high use: kernel density estimation, Getis-Ord G(i)*, hotspot persistence and hotspots conditional on presence, which represent the range of quantitative hotspot estimation approaches used in waterbird analyses. We applied each of the methods to aerial survey waterbird count data collected in the Great Lakes from 2012-2014. For each approach, we identified areas of high use for seven species/species groups and then compared the results across all methods and to mean effort-corrected counts. Our results indicate that formal hotspot analysis frameworks do not always lead to the same conclusions. The kernel density and Getis-Ord G(i)* methods yielded the most similar results across all species analysed and were generally correlated with mean effort-corrected count data. We found that these two models can differ substantially from the hotspot persistence and hotspots conditional on presence estimation approaches, which were not consistently similar to one another. The hotspot persistence approach differed most significantly from the other methods but is the only method to explicitly account for temporal variation. We recommend considering the ecological question and scale of conservation or management activities prior to designing survey methodologies. Deciding the appropriate definition and scale for analysis is critical for interpretation of hotspot analysis results as is inclusion of important covariates. Combining hotspot analysis methods using an integrative approach, either within a single analysis or post hoc, could lead to greater consistency in the identification of waterbird hotspots.","[Sussman, Allison L.; Zipkin, Elise F.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Coll Nat Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Sussman, Allison L.; Zipkin, Elise F.] Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Gardner, Beth; Adams, Evan M.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Adams, Evan M.; Williams, Kathryn A.] Biodivers Res Inst, Portland, ME USA; [Salas, Leo] Point Blue Conservat Sci, Petaluma, CA USA; [Kenow, Kevin P.] US Geol Survey, Upper Midwest Environm Sci Ctr, La Crosse, WI USA; [Luukkonen, David R.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Monfils, Michael J.] Michigan State Univ Extens, Michigan Nat Features Inventory, Lansing, MI USA; [Mueller, William P.] Western Great Lakes Bird & Bat Observ, Port Washington, WI USA; [Leduc-Lapierre, Michele] Great Lakes Commiss, Ann Arbor, MI USA","Sussman, AL (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Coll Nat Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.; Sussman, AL (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",sussman7@msu.edu,,"Zipkin, Elise/0000-0003-4155-6139; Adams, Evan/0000-0002-4327-6926; Kenow, Kevin/0000-0002-3062-5197",U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act grants program,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act grants program,,58,3,3,3,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

While such aggregates are difficult to study in the field, models of aggregation offer researchers a way to investigate how the interplay of individual behaviour makes aggregation possible and leads to different aggregate-level behaviour. This paper reviews the findings of models of aggregation, both mathematical and computer-based, with a focus on the means used to validate these models. In the context of this review it is argued that the existing de facto modelling framework, the Attraction Repulsion (AR) framework, does not allow for an adequate representation of the properties of individuals required to create validatable models of natural aggregation. However, it is further argued that the increasing use of information or perceptual fields in AR models provides a promising direction for future research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Males and females of this species showed opposite changes of body mass and body condition during the dry and the wet season. Male body mass declined during the dry season that coincides with mating, while female body mass remained constant, During the wet season that coincides with lactation, female body mass declined but male body mass increased. This indicates that changes in body mass are not linked as much to environmental seasonality as to mating and reproduction. The distribution of L. ruficaudatus was most significantly related to the spatial distribution of leaf protein during the wet season. Neither the availability nor the chemical composition of leaves eaten during the dry season affected the spatial distribution of L. ruficaudatus. These findings are consistent with hypotheses that constraints are most severe during the times of lactation and weaning and that distributions of primates reflect their food requirements in order to optimize their reproductive success. They are inconsistent with the idea that the lean dry season is the most stressful time of year for lemurs in energetic or nutritive terms.","Univ Hamburg, Inst Zool, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; Univ Hamburg, Zool Museum, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany","Ganzhorn, JU (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Zool, Martin Luther King Pl 3, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",ganzhorn@zoologie.uni-hamburg.de,"Ganzhorn, Joerg/AAO-6955-2020","Ganzhorn, Joerg/0000-0003-1395-9758",,,,63,84,89,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2002,131,3,,,,,427,435,,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,557YH,28547715,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

Our study contrasts the effectiveness, in terms of power and type I error rates, of the Mantel test and PROTEST. We illustrate the application of Procrustes superimposition to visually examine the concordance of observations for each dimension separately and how to conduct hypothesis testing in which the association between two data sets is tested while controlling for the variation related to other sources of data. Our simulation results show that PROTEST is as powerful or more powerful than the Mantel test for detecting matrix association under a variety of possible scenarios. As a result of the increased power of PROTEST and the ability to assess the match for individual observations (not available with the Mantel test), biologists now have an additional and powerful analytical tool to study ecological and evolutionary relationships.","Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada","Peres-Neto, PR (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, 25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",,"Jackson, Donald A/J-6441-2013","Jackson, Donald A/0000-0002-6107-0753; Peres Neto, Pedro/0000-0002-5629-8067",,,,43,588,599,3,108,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,2001,129,2,,,,,169,178,,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,486TY,28547594,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

For species in which the fruit provides marked protection of the seed there is a significant negative linear relationship between N and log seed mass. There is a similar relationship for 'unprotected' species, but the intercept on the y-axis is significantly and markedly higher for the group of 'protected' species. This relationship holds true when genera rather than species are considered We are also able to make taxonomically controlled comparisons within six families and within four genera: all six familial comparisons and two of the generic comparisons support the finding for the collection of species as a whole. We then compare the [N] in the EE of species in which the fruit does not offer marked protection, but in which there is a range of investment in the seed wall fraction.

We analyzed understory vegetation using an approach that combined plant functional types and vertical stratification to evaluate the effects of human disturbances on the ecological integrity of sugar maple-dominated stands in southern Quebec. Ecological integrity was evaluated by analyzing the divergence of understory species assemblages from those observed in comparable unmanaged forest. Multivariate analyses of biological traits revealed 13 emergent groups that share common traits associated with a similar life history strategy. Responses of these groups, of specific traits, and of understory structure to different human disturbances were tested. Nine of the 13 emergent groups varied in occurrence or diversity among disturbance types. Analyses also revealed a set of traits specifically associated with unmanaged old growth forest, indicating that species possessing these traits may be sensitive to human disturbance. Overall, the understory vegetation assemblage was found to be relatively stable among all human disturbances investigated. However, our results suggest some issues of possible long-term conservation concern given a continuation of human disturbances: (i) an increase of species associated with open environment, including exotic species; (ii) a decrease of spring geophytes; (iii) a decrease of certain shade-tolerant forbs; and (iv) a modification of understory structure by the development of a dense sapling stratum.","Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, UMR 7179, F-91800 Brunoy, France; Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, Ctr Etud Foret, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Aubin, I (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, 4101 Rue Sherbrooke Est, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada.",iaubin@sympatico.ca,,,,,,89,53,53,3,43,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1195-6860,2376-7626,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2007,14,2,,,,,259,271,,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,182EO,,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

The trophic network model was derived from an Ecopath application made for a shallow water area (Palude delta Rosa), situated in the northern part of the Lagoon of Venice. The organisms-specific output data from the energy model, such as metabolic rates, diet composition and structural characteristics were used as input to the ecotoxicological food chain model. The toxic substance model estimated bioaccumulation (pg/g lipid) of dioxins (e.g. 2378-TCDD, 12378-PeCDD, 123478-HxCDD, 123789-HxCDD, 1234678-HpCDD and 12346789-OCDD) and dibenzofurans (e.g. 2378-TCDF, 12378-PeCDF, 123478-HxCDF, 123678-HxCDF, 123789-HxCDF, 234678-HxCDF, 1234678-HpCDF, 1234789-HpCDF and 12346789-OCDF) for all groups in the trophic network. A sensitivity analysis showed that the toxic concentration in the aquatic species was highly affected by the following parameters: K-ow, fraction of organic carbon in the sediment, lipid fraction, and fraction of unassimilated food. The coupling of the two models was validated with data from four sites in the Lagoon (two in the industrial zone, and two in the southern basin). Calibration and comparisons with measured data were conducted for a clam (Tapes phillppinarum), a mussel (Mytilus edulis) and a fish (Scardinius eritrophtalamus). Model output showed that the discrepancy between chemical analysis and model estimations were in the range of one order of magnitude for T. philippinarum and M. edulis (except for tetra- and penta-furans, where the overestimation reached two order of magnitude). It was also shown that more monitoring efforts should be made on fish species, to have a set of data useful for the validation of the model. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Small (Euphorbiaceae) were investigated in a natural population in western Japan. Seedlings emerged from mid-June to early October, with three peaks: mid-June, late July and late August. Plants that emerged in June commenced sexual reproduction from late July, and thereafter both vegetative growth and sexual reproduction occurred together until early November, the plants showing no switching from vegetative growth to sexual reproduction. Seedlings that emerged in June and July suffered high mortality, but most seedlings that emerged from August onward survived until the reproductive stage. The minimum size for reproduction was largest for plants that emerged early in file season, and it decreased with a delay in seedling emergence. The late emergence of seedlings that resulted in low reproductive output may be to some extent compensated for by the increased probability of survival in the seedling stage. A transplant experiment clarified that C. maculata call repeat a maximum of three overlapping generations within a year. Multiple generations per year were attained by non-dormant seeds produced in the first and second generations and clearly resulted in an increased reproductive output per year. The life cycle with multiple overlapping generations may have been acquired in habitats where unpredictable disturbance results in temporally unsuitable conditions for germination. vegetative growth and sexual reproduction of annual plants, but where suitable conditions frequently continue over a period longer than the single generation time of annual plants.","Saga Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Appl Biol Sci, Saga 8408502, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan","Suzuki, N (corresponding author), Saga Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Appl Biol Sci, 1 Honjo, Saga 8408502, Japan.",suzukin@cc.saga-u.ac.jp,,,,,,55,9,9,0,10,SPRINGER TOKYO,TOKYO,"3-3-13, HONGO, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0033, JAPAN",0912-3814,,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

While the relationship between any two of these traits that influence net photosynthetic rate is constrained to some degree, there is sufficient flexibility to allow the evolution of different but more or less equally effective interrelationships among these central elements of leaf form and function. We use contemporary techniques of structural equation modelling to describe the general nature of such evolutionary diversification in leaf form and function among these wetland plants. Our model essentially extends the Cowan-Farquhar model of stomatal regulation to include relationships between SLM and foliar nitrogen. The model can take two forms, with variables expressed as either per unit leaf area or per unit leaf mass. When variables are expressed on an areal basis, the model predicts that a species with a higher SLM will have a higher foliar nitrogen level. The foliar nitrogen level, in accordance with the Cowan-Farquhar model, in turn determines the dynamics of stomatal regulation in relation to the marginal cost of water loss relative to carbon gain. The dependence of stomatal regulation on foliar nitrogen also determines the maximal rates of stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis. Internal CO2 concentrations within the leaf follow as a necessary consequence of these interrelationships. This areal-based model describes the data for the 35 C-3 wetland species well; the same basic model applies to the five C-4 Species in our sample, except for shifts in the quantitative effects of net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance on internal CO2 levels. When the variables are expressed on a mass basis, a slightly different model results, as net photosynthetic rate decreases directly with SLM and is not related to species level variation in either leaf nitrogen concentration or maximal stomatal conductance. Both forms of the model indicate the need to advance our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary basis for variation in SLM, including its association with traits such as leaf demography and canopy architecture as well as environmental characteristics of the habitats where particular species predominate.","Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada","Shipley, B (corresponding author), Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.",bshipley@courrier.usherb.ca; Martin@Biol.lan.mcgill.ca,"Shipley, Bill/A-4578-2011; Lechowicz, Martin/Y-7211-2019","Shipley, Bill/0000-0002-7026-3880;",,,,36,45,50,4,29,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1195-6860,2376-7626,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2000,7,2,,,,,183,194,,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,324FE,,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

The existence of inducible or constitutive (permanent) defences is expected to temper the lethal effects of fish on tadpoles. According to current theories on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, the amphibian species that occur in habitats that are mostly or often fish-free were expected to display inducible defences, while the species that reproduce mainly in fish ponds ought to present constitutive defences. The tested species were Rana dalmatina, Hyla arborea and R. ridibunda, respectively. As expected, R. ridibunda tadpoles were less vulnerable to fish predation than the other species. Nevertheless, all three species exhibited morphological responses in the presence of fish. Their increases in tail area and decreases in body depth were similar. However, behaviour was only modified in R. dalmatina, which exhibited lower activity rates and higher refuge use in the presence of fish cues. Such lower activity rates were related to lower growth and developmental rates. While not detected in this experiment, the existence of inducible defences in the three species suggests the existence of costs of antipredator defence. Those costs may have delayed effects so that increasing the frequency of fish ponds may exacerbate the impact of delayed costs whatever the species, suggesting that the dynamics of species that are not fish-adverse could also suffer from the introduction of fish.","Univ Lyon 1, Lab Ecol Hydrosyst Fluviaux, F-191869622 Villeurbanne, France","Plenet, S (corresponding author), Univ Lyon 1, Lab Ecol Hydrosyst Fluviaux, 41-43 Bd 11 Novembre, F-191869622 Villeurbanne, France.",plenet@univ-lyon1.fr,"Teplitsky, Celine/H-3621-2019","Teplitsky, Celine/0000-0001-9458-709X",,,,39,77,83,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2003,134,2,,,,,270,277,,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,642UH,12647168,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

Using the concept of statistical odds, an alternative diversity measure with an appealing interpretation is formulated as a simple modification of the popular Simpson index. If SIGMA-p(i)2 denotes the sum of the squared proportions of individuals belonging to the different species in the sample, the new odds measure of diversity is simply defined by OD = (SIGMA-p(i)2)-1-1 and has the following interpretation: OD is the odds that two individuals selected at random (with replacement) from the sample are of different species. The same modification is also applied to a couple of other measures in use, providing them with convenient odds interpretations. These measures are all members of the same parameterized family, which represents a slight modification of the Hill's family. The inverse of OD is proposed as an odds measure of species homogeneity. Also, some properties of the different measures are outlined, and the measurement of evenness is discussed.

In other words, we know that plant traits can vary widely for a given genotype, but we know little about the importance of trait-mediated interactions (TMI) among plants. Here, we discuss three major factors that affect the expression of phenotypic plasticity: variation in the abiotic environment, variation in the presence or identity of neighbors, and variation in herbivory. We consider how plastic responses to these factors might affect interactions among plants. Plastic responses to the abiotic environment have important consequences for conditionality in competitive effects, to the point of causing shifts from competitive to facilitative interactions. Because plants show a high degree of plasticity in response to neighbors, and even to the specific identify of neighbors, phenotypic plasticity may allow species to adjust to the composition of their communities, promoting coexistence and community diversity. Likewise, plastic responses to consumers may have various and counterintuitive consequences: induction of plant resistance, compensatory growth, and increased resource uptake may affect interactions among plants in ways that cannot be predicted simply by considering biomass lost to consumers. What little we know about TMI among plants suggests that they should not be ignored in plant community theory. Although work to date on the community consequences of phenotypic plasticity has been hampered by experimental constraints, new approaches such as manipulating phenotypes by using signals instead of actual environmental conditions and the use of transgenic plants should allow us to rapidly expand our understanding of the community consequences of plant plasticity.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA; Univ Georgia, Dept Bot, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Callaway, RM (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",callaway@selway.umt.edu,"Pennings, Steven C/A-8326-2013; Richards, Christina/C-6455-2008","Pennings, Steven C/0000-0003-4757-7125; Richards, Christina/0000-0001-7848-5165",,,,181,347,378,17,316,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2003,84,5,,,,,1115,1128,,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,700PN,,Green Published,,,9/23/21,,

The statistical analysis revealed a statistically significant quadratic dependence between the radon flow density from the earth's surface and the subsoil radon volumetric activity in the studied soils with the various grain-size distribution. This trend was determined in the summer during the data analysis of synchronous and space-aligned measurements of the radon field specified parameters in the soil. According to the grain-size distribution, the studied soils are specified by light (23%), medium-textured (25%), and heavy clay (27%) loams, less often by the sandy loams (14%) and sands (11%). The average radon flow density in the sands and sandy loams is 1.1 and 1.7 times lower, and in the light and medium-textured loams is 55% and 21% lower, respectively than in the heavy clay loams prevailing at a depth of 0.4-1 m. The most sensitive parameter of the radon field to the soil grain-size distribution for the combined spatiotemporal measurements is the ratio of the radon flow density from the earth's surface to the subsoil radon volumetric activity, that is, the radon transfer rate. It is confirmed by the works of other authors. A linear decrease in the radon flow rate from a depth of 1 m to the soil surface was revealed.","[Alimova, Gulsem Salimovna; Tokareva, Alena Yur'evna] Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, Tobolsk Complex Sci Stn, 15 Acad Yury Osipov St, Tobolsk 626152, Russia","Alimova, GS (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, Tobolsk Complex Sci Stn, 15 Acad Yury Osipov St, Tobolsk 626152, Russia.",gulsem76@mail.ru,"alimova, gulsem/AAU-5747-2021; Alena, Tokareva/AAU-5879-2021",,,,,19,0,0,0,0,"NATL CAVE RESEARCH & PROTECTION ORGANIZATION, INDIA",RAIPUR,"3-40 CIVIL LINES, RAJATALAB, RAIPUR, CG 492001, INDIA",2348-5191,2348-8980,,AMBIENT SCI,Ambient Sci.,,2021,8,1,,,,,,,,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QY7GG,,gold,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

Long-term observations of leaves were made in trees standing either within intermittently flooded waterways or at an average of 37.5 m from the edge of the waterways. The mean soil moisture content was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) greater in the waterways than in the non-flooded areas. Trees in the higher soil moisture regime produced significantly larger basal area increments and increased canopy leaf area. This increase in canopy leaf area was achieved, in part, through a significant increase in leaf longevity and mean leaf size. Although a greater number of leaves was initiated and abscissed per shoot from the non-flooded trees, more leaves were collected from litter traps beneath the denser canopies of the flooded trees. Consumption of foliage by insects on the trees subjected to flooding compared to the non-flooded trees was not significantly different. However, the relative impact of insect herbivory was significantly greater on the non-flooded trees. Leaf chewing was the most common form of damage by insects, particularly Chrysomelidae and Curculionidae. No species was present in outbreak during this study. Leaf survival decreased as the per cent area eaten per leaf increased. In addition, irrespective of the level of herbivory, leaf abscission tended to be higher in E. camaldulensis under moisture deficit.

However, a type of data already available from mark-recapture studies (dates of capture and recapture of individually marked animals) can reveal social substructure within snake populations. If individuals associate with each other in social groups, we expect synchrony in the dates of capture and recapture of those animals. A field study of turtle-headed sea snakes (Emydocephalus annulatus) in New Caledonia reveals exactly this phenomenon. For example, animals that were captured on the same day in one year often were recaptured on the same day the following year. Analysis rejects non-social interpretations of these data (such as spatial-temporal confounding in sampling, intrapopulation heterogeneity in cues for activity), suggesting instead that many individual sea snakes belong to 'social' groups that consistently move about together. The phenomenon of capture synchrony during mark-recapture studies can provide new insights into the occurrence and correlates of cryptic social aggregations.","Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Shine, R (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",rics@bio.usyd.edu.au,"Shine, Richard/B-8711-2008","Shine, James/0000-0003-1762-5499",,,,49,18,19,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,NOV,2005,30,7,,,,,805,811,,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,971OK,,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

Carotenoids are micronutrients with many beneficial health-related effects. They are effective antioxidants and stimulants of the immune system. Carotenoids cannot be synthesized in animals and must be obtained from food. As such, they may limit reproductive output and performance, and on the proximate level mediate reproductive trade-offs. 2. We studied carotenoid limitation in wild Great Tits (Parus major) by supplementing prelaying and laying females with lutein, the most abundant carotenoid in this species. We followed the effects of this supplementation on egg yolk carotenoid composition, and offspring and parental performance. 3. Females transferred the supplemented lutein into egg yolks, increasing lutein concentration to the upper limit of naturally occurring concentrations in control pairs. Concentrations of zeaxanthin, beta-carotene and alpha-carotene did not differ between supplemented and control pairs. 4. Effects on offspring and parental performance were generally absent or weak. There were no effects on timing of laying, clutch size, hatching success, nestling survival, nestling mass (day 6 and 14), tarsus length or T-cell mediated immune response. Males on supplemented nests fed their young more than those on control nests. There was no positive effect on female feeding or mass. 5. Negligible effects of lutein supplementation on offspring and parental performance might be explained by high natural abundance of carotenoids or other antioxidants, where additional carotenoids bear no strong advantage to the birds. Additionally, conflicting results of different studies may be explained by species-specific features of their life-histories.","Palacky Univ, Dept Zool, CZ-77146 Olomouc, Czech Republic; Nat Hist Museum, CZ-77173 Olomouc, Czech Republic; Univ Milan, Ist Chim Organ A Marchesini, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Remes, V (corresponding author), Palacky Univ, Dept Zool, Tr Svobody 26, CZ-77146 Olomouc, Czech Republic.",vladimir.remes@upol.cz,"Remes, Vladimir/B-6842-2016",,,,,38,20,20,0,11,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

We investigated habitat preferences to understand how different cockroach species coexist in sugar-cane fields on Reunion island. Cockroach populations belonging to a guild of seven species were surveyed during one annual cycle in eight sugar-cane fields that differed by several environmental factors, in order to investigate ecological features of cockroach species and their patterns of coexistence. Structure variations of the cockroach communities were analyzed at the field scale, at the sample unit scale, and according to variations of environmental conditions related to the annual sugar-cane growth cycle. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to elucidate relationships between species diversity, population abundance and environmental characteristics. The examination of partitioning at different spatial and temporal scales evidenced that each species occupied a particular type of habitat. The main factors influencing spatial habitat selection were at the sample unit scale: presence of ants, edge effect, soil moisture and granulometry, at the field scale: irrigation, annual rainfall, altitude and age of the field. Although a pair of species shared the same type of habitat, annual population peaks of each species did not coincide in time. This suggests that resource partitioning is based both on ecological factors and interspecific competition. Factors enhancing cockroach coexistence and factors favoring population outbursts are discussed as well as specific invasive capacities of these cockroaches and the role of the cockroach community in the sugar-cane trophic web.

Two species of host trees, C. sinensis and C. jessoensis (height = 2 m or more) were found in riparian forests on sandbanks (hereinafter, riparian forest), in forest regenerated after landslides on valley walls (landslide tracks), in secondary deciduous forests consisting mainly of Quercus acutissima or Quercus serrata and in forests established at abandoned paddy fields and their periphery, where weeds and shrubs used to be mown frequently to avoid shade on the paddies before their abandonment. This suggests that they are pioneer species, and their distribution and regeneration depend on natural and/or human disturbances. Host trees above 2 m were preferred by larvae, and there were very few such trees in secondary forests. More overwintering larvae occurred in riparian forests than at other sites. The number of S. charonda adults was highest at the edge of riparian forests, and we observed a variety of behaviors such as puddling, chasing and mating there. Although the number of adult butterflies was smaller inside and at the edge of secondary forests than in riparian forests, puddling by males and roosting on the trunk of Q. acutissima or Q. serrata by females were observed more frequently there than in riparian forests. Thus, we conclude that landscapes including both riparian forests with natural disturbance and secondary forests with Quercus trees are necessary to maintain host Celtis trees and S. charonda populations.","[Kobayashi, Takato; Kitahara, Masahiko] Yamanashi Inst Environm Sci, Lab Anim Ecol, Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi 4030005, Japan; [Nakashizuka, Tohru] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Kubo, Masako] Yamanashi Forest Res Inst, Masuho, Yamanashi 4000502, Japan; [Ito, Shoko] Utsunomiya Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Forest Ecol & Silviculture, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3218505, Japan","Kobayashi, T (corresponding author), K-101,2-2-18 Umezono, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050045, Japan.",takatokoba46@yahoo.co.jp,"Nakashizuka, Tohru/AAO-1081-2020",,,,,26,2,3,0,13,SPRINGER TOKYO,TOKYO,"1-11-11 KUDAN-KITA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 102-0073, JAPAN",0912-3814,,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Maculinea butterflies have highly specialized larvae that sequentially exploit a plant and an ant species. Our study establishes that M. arion's specialized life cycle, including scramble competition for limiting resources, and the spatially discrete nature of its resources, make it more sensitive to environmental variation and more prone to local extinction than other univoltine phytophagous species. We find that the number and spatial distribution of the butterfly's resources are key factors in their population dynamics, especially for M. arion populations in habitats associated with high larval survival and high adult fecundity. Factors that increase juvenile competition have first a positive effect on adult population size, but beyond a threshold this effect becomes negative. In general, oscillatory dynamics emerge for high potential growth rates and spatially homogeneous juvenile competition. We discuss the relevance of our results to population management, investigate the consequences of environmental variation, and consider different scenarios of conservation. Our model, although based on the Maculinea genus, should apply to a broad range of species for which the form of competitive interactions changes predictably at distinct points in the life cycle. Complex life cycles can lead to negative feedbacks involving parameters that are usually thought to optimize population size. We suggest that conservation strategies are neither generalizable for the Maculinea genus nor for disparate populations of each species of Maculinea, and rather that management should be conducted on a case-by-case basis.","Univ Montpellier 2, ISEM, UMR 5554, F-34095 Montpellier, France; NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Dorset Lab, Winfrith Technol Ctr, Dorchester DT2 8ZD, England","Mouquet, N (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier 2, ISEM, UMR 5554, Pl Eugene Bataillon,CC065, F-34095 Montpellier, France.",nmouquet@univ-montp2.fr,"Clarke, Ralph T/B-3859-2009; MOUQUET, Nicolas/AAL-1440-2021; Thomas, Jeremy/A-9619-2013; Mouquet, Nicolas/G-1285-2010","Mouquet, Nicolas/0000-0003-1840-6984",,,,54,32,34,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Such a beta cannot be used to compare regions that differ in alpha diversity. To avoid misinterpretation, existing definitions of alpha and beta must be replaced by a definition that partitions diversity into independent alpha and beta components. Such a unique definition is derived here. When these new alpha and beta components are transformed into their numbers equivalents ( effective numbers of elements), Whittaker's multiplicative law ( alpha x beta gamma) is necessarily true for all indices. The new beta gives the effective number of distinct communities. The most popular similarity and overlap measures of ecology (Jaccard, Sorensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indices) are monotonic transformations of the new beta diversity.

If management (treatment) is applied nonrandomly, as in observational studies, then analysis must account for the potential confounding caused by variables that could have influenced both treatment assignment and the outcome of interest. Methods that do not adjust for all confounding variables can only estimate associations between treatment and outcome, not treatment effects. Data collected in observational studies are usually analysed with linear or generalized linear models, which can estimate treatment effects by adjusting for confounding variables. However, if there is little overlap in the distributions of confounding variables among the treatment groups then conventional regression extrapolates to areas of the covariate space where at least one of the treatment groups was unlikely to be observed. An alternative procedure for assessing treatment effects is to use the propensity score, which is the probability of treatment assignment given potential confounding variables. The propensity score can be used to reduce systematic differences in confounding variables among the treatment groups, ensuring that data more closely resemble that expected under a randomized experiment. The propensity score also identifies situations where treatment inferences must rely on strong assumptions. We used Monte Carlo simulation to examine the properties of commonly used propensity score methods for estimating treatment effects in the presence of nonrandom allocation of treatments. We then illustrated their application in a case study estimating the effects of invasive herbivore management on tree condition. Our results indicate that propensity score methods can be robust to model misspecification, allowing the estimation of average causal effects and resulting in more reliable inferences. We discuss key considerations for using propensity score methods for analysing ecological data.","[Ramsey, David S.

This study investigated (1) the feasibility of using coral nurseries for restoration projects, (2) the minimum size required for a Pocillopora damicornis (Pocilloporidae) coral fragment to survive and grow in a nursery, and (3) the optimal transplant size of a fragment when transplanted to a degraded reef at Gorgona Island (Colombian Pacific). For this investigation, 230 fragments were transplanted directly to El Remanso reef, and another 150 fragments were maintained in in situ nurseries. Every 2 months, the length, weight, and survival of the fragments were recorded. After growing for 134 days in the nurseries, the 52 surviving fragments were transplanted to El Remanso reef, and after 5 months, the same variables were measured. Among the nursery-reared fragments, the largest (4 to <8 cm) had the highest survival and growth rates, whereas among the directly transplanted fragments, the smallest fragments (<2 cm) had the highest survival and growth rates. However, the nursery-reared fragments acquired greater structural complexity (arborescent morphology), and they were all alive 156 days after transplantation and presented a maximum linear growth rate of over 2 cm, which was higher than that of the directly transplanted fragments. Apparently, the arborescent morphology acquired during the nursery period provides advantages to the colonies that favor greater success when transplanted. Therefore, nursery-reared fragments of P. damicornis between 2 and 4 cm are the most appropriate for use in restoration projects.","[Ishida-Castaneda, Jun; Zapata, Fernando A.] Univ Valle, Dept Biol, Cali 760032, Colombia; [Pizarro, Valeria] Fdn ECOMARES, Cali 760050, Valle Del Cauca, Colombia; [Lopez-Victoria, Mateo] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Dept Nat Sci & Math, Cali 760008, Colombia; [Ishida-Castaneda, Jun] Univ Ryukyus, Trop Biosphere Res Ctr, 3422 Sesoko, Motobu, Okinawa 9050227, Japan","Ishida-Castaneda, J (corresponding author), Univ Valle, Dept Biol, Cali 760032, Colombia.; Ishida-Castaneda, J (corresponding author), Univ Ryukyus, Trop Biosphere Res Ctr, 3422 Sesoko, Motobu, Okinawa 9050227, Japan.",junpanese@gmail.com,,,National Natural Parks of Colombia,Special thanks to the National Natural Parks of Colombia for financial and logistical support and to the Universidad del Valle and the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali for providing equipment.

This quantitative examination of larval interactions between C. septempunctata and Coleomegilla maculata (DeCeer) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), a Nearctic coccinellid, was conducted under controlled prey densities. Larvae of both coccinellid species are affected by a limited diet [one pea aphid per day Acrythosiphon pisum (Harris) (Homoptera: Aphididae)] compared with an excess diet (> 20 aphids per day). Larval survival decreased from 86 to 63% in C. maculata and from 84 to 33% in C. septempunctata; mean preimaginal developmental time increased from 20.6 to 26.7 days in C. maculata, and from 18.1 to 32.0 days in C. septempunctata. Additionally, on one aphid per day, mean adult weight was reduced from 12.39 to 9.79 mg in C. maculata, and from 39.57 to 14.44 mg in C. septempunctata. Interspecific interactions, favoring C. septeumpunctata over C. maculata at a low prey density (one aphid per day), take the form of reduced survival of C. maculata compared with C. septempunctata (14 versus 66%). Reduced survival of C. maculata may be the result of competition for aphids or intraguild predation by C. septempunctata on C. maculata. No interspecific interactions (measured as effects on larval survival, preimaginal developmental time, and adult weight) were observed between larvae of these two species at a high prey density (> 20 aphids per predator per day).","Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Entomol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Oklahoma State Univ, Stillwater, OK USA","Obrycki, JJ (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Entomol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",,,,,,,48,104,112,0,13,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1998,117,2-Jan,,,,,279,285,,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,144YZ,28308499,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

In the first stage, an individual-based forest ecosystem carbon flux model (IntCarb) at stand scale is developed. IntCarb combines components from,the ZELIG and CENTURY models to simulate forest development and heterotrophic respiration, respectively. Stand scale carbon fluxes simulated by IntCarb strongly depend on stand age. A forest stand can be a carbon sink for up to 200 years old with a peak at 30-40 years old. Old-growth stands are carbon neutral to the atmosphere in the long term. For any particular year, an old-growth stand can be either a carbon sink or source. The interannual variation of Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) for an old-growth stand is primarily determined by heterotrophic respiration. Due to the high spatial variability of stand ages, forest age structure needs to be taken into account to improve estimation of carbon budgets of forest ecosystems over large areas. In the stand stage, a regional carbon budget model (RegCarb) is developed to estimate regional carbon fluxes over large areas based on forest age structure, adjusting for the nonrespiratory carbon losses (timber harvesting). Our initial estimate with RegCarb for the Pacific Northwest of the United States indicates that this region was a tremendous carbon source to the atmosphere from 1890 to 1990 due to extensive logging of old-growth forest. Projection for the role of forests in this region in global carbon cycle in the future strongly depend on the amount of timber to be harvested, i.e. how the age structure of forests in this region is to be altered.

For better understanding the broad-scale impact of the earthquake along the continental shelf and slope, it is necessary to extract occurrence data of organisms from biological surveys. Gathering image or video data is appropriate for this purpose because most underwater surveys simultaneously record images and/or videos.

Changes in mean aridity associated with climate change can generate ecotype by environment mismatch (i.e., climatic displacement). At the same time, variability around these shifting means is predicted to increase, resulting in more extreme droughts. We characterized the effects of two axes of climate change, climatic displacement and drought, on the shrub Artemisia californica and its arthropods. We established common gardens of plants sourced along an aridity gradient (3.5-fold variation in mean annual precipitation) in an arid region of the species distribution, thus generating a gradient of climatic displacement (sustained increase in aridity) as predicted with climate change. We surveyed plants and arthropods over eight years where precipitation varied sixfold, including both extreme drought and relatively mesic conditions. These two axes of climate change interacted to influence plant performance, such that climatically displaced populations grew slowly regardless of drought and suffered substantial mortality during drought years. Conversely, local populations grew quickly, increased growth during wet years, and had low mortality regardless of drought. Effects on plant annual arthropod yield were negative and additive, with drought effects exceeding that of climatic displacement by 24%. However, for plant lifetime arthropod yield, incorporating effects on both plant growth and survival, climatic displacement exacerbated the negative effects of drought. Collectively these results demonstrate how climatic displacement (through increasing aridity stress) strengthens the negative effects of drought on plants and, indirectly, on arthropods, suggesting the possibility of climate-mediated trophic collapse.","[Croy, Jordan R.; Pratt, Jessica D.; Mooney, Kailen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Sheng, Daniel] Cty Angeles Fire Dept, Div Forestry, Los Angeles, CA 91773 USA","Croy, JR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",jcroy@uci.edu,,"Croy, Jordan/0000-0002-4743-0302","Newkirk Center for Science and Society; Orange County Association of Environmental Professionals; Newport Bay Conservancy; Lake Forest Garden Club; UC-Irvine Graduate Division; NSF-DEBNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1120794, 1354734]; NSF-DGENational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF- Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR) [1321846]; Victor and Virginia Voth Foundation;  [NSF-GK12 DGE-0638751];  [EPA-STAR FP-91724101]","We thank our field and lab assistants for help with data collection and arthropod sample processing.

Browsing has been suggested to decrease the carbohydrate reserves in woody plants, which might lead to reduced tannin production in leaves during the following summer, and consequently, to increased herbivore damage on leaves. We conducted a clipping experiment with mature mountain birch trees and measured the effects of clipping on birch growth, leaf chemistry and toughness, as well as on the performance of insect herbivores. Leaves grew larger and heavier per unit area in the clipped ramets and had a higher content of proteins than leaves in the control trees. Clipping treatment did not affect the total content of sugars in the leaves (mg g(-1)), suggesting that a moderate level of clipping did not significantly reduce the carbohydrate pools of fully-grown mountain birch trees. Furthermore, the contents of proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) and gallotannins were slightly higher in the leaves of clipped ramets, contrary to the hypothesis of reduced tannin production. The effects of clipping treatment on leaf and shoot growth and on foliar chemistry were mainly restricted to the clipped ramets, without spreading to untreated ramets within the same tree individual. The effects of clipping on leaf characters varied during the growing season; for instance, leaf toughness in clipped ramets was higher than toughness in control trees and ramets only when leaves were mature. Accordingly, clipping had inconsistent effects on insect herbivores feeding at different times of the growing season. The generally small impact of clipping on herbivore performance suggests that the low intensity of natural browsing at the study area, simulated by our clipping treatment, does not have strong consequences for the population dynamics of insect herbivores on mountain birch via enhanced population growth caused by browsing-induced changes in food quality.","Turku Univ, Subarct Res Stn, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Turku Univ, Dept Chem, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland","Riipi, M (corresponding author), Turku Univ, Subarct Res Stn, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",mariipi@utu.fi,"Ossipov, Vladimir/M-2717-2016","Ossipov, Vladimir/0000-0002-8383-9965",,,,50,20,20,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2005,111,2,,,,,221,234,,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,979XU,,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

In a worst-case scenario, the decline of generalist pollinators is predicted to trigger cascades of linked declines among the multiple specialist plant species to which they are linked, but this has not been documented. I Studied a portion of a pollination web involving a generalist pollinator, the oil-collecting bee Rediviva peringueyi, and a community of oil-secreting plants. Across 27 established conservation areas located in the Cape Floral Region, I found substantial variation in the bees' occurrence in relation to soil type and the successional stage of the vegetation. Anthropogenic declines were detectable against this background of naturally occurring variation: R. peringueyi was absent from small conservation areas (<385 ha) in an urban matrix. In the absence of the bee, seed set failed in six specialist plant species that are pollinated only by R. peringueyi but remained high in a pollination generalist, which had replacement pollinators. The findings are consistent with theoretical predictions of the importance of generalist pollinators in maintaining the structure of pollination webs.","Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","Pauw, A (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag 11, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",apauw@sun.ac.za,"Pauw, Anton/A-6126-2008","Pauw, Anton/0000-0002-4012-648X",,,,51,134,142,5,129,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2007,88,7,,,,,1759,1769,,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,185SN,17645022,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

An enclosure experiment was conducted in the Potreirinho creek, a second order tributary of Paranapanema River, SE Brazil. Five treatments were used: enclosure of the predator species. enclosure of the detritivorous species, enclosure of both together, exclusion of all fish species (closed control cage), and cage open to all fish community, (open control). Through direct and indirect effects, I. mirini, when alone gave rise to a trophic cascade that resulted in a positive effect on algal resources. Through direct effects, H. depressicauda. when alone, reduced the amount of organic matter, resulting in a positive indirect effect on algae. In addition, when the two species were enclosed together, only the effects determined by the detritivorous species were present. The results indicate the important role of the intermediate detritivorous species in the maintenance of the composition and trophic structure of the analyzed community by reducing the effects caused by the top predator.","[Uieda, V.

We investigated how a natural population of ovipositing treefrogs, Hyla chrysoscelis, partitioned their eggs amongst experimental ponds differing in the non-lethal presence of five fish predators, each representing a distinct family. Four fish predators were functionally equivalent in terms of the behavioral response they induced in H. chrysoscelis females and hence the distribution of larval H. chrysoscelis. Mean number of H. chrysoscelis eggs deposited was significantly decreased by the mere presence of these predators relative to controls, with three species eliciting a complete avoidance (e.g. no eggs deposited). One fish predator, Aphredoderus sayanus, was statistically indistinguishable from the control treatment. These data mimic patterns of species distribution observed in nature in response to the presence of fish, but suggest an alternative mechanism for generating patterns of prey abundance amongst habitats differing in their predator composition. Furthermore, our results expand the importance of predator induced non-lethal effects as a process that could dramatically affect population and community level dynamics.","Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA","Binckley, CA (corresponding author), Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",cbinc001@odu.edu,,,,,,72,66,70,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,2003,102,3,,,,,623,629,,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,715DP,,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

CO2FIX V.2 is a multi-cohort ecosystem-level model based on carbon accounting of forest stands, including forest biomass, soils and products. Carbon stored in living biomass is estimated with a forest cohort model that allows for competition, natural mortality, logging, and mortality due to logging damage. Soil carbon is modeled using five stock pools, three for litter and two for humus. The dynamics of carbon stored in wood products is simulated with a set of pools for short-, medium- and long-lived products, and includes processing efficiency, re-use of by-products, recycling, and disposal forms. The CO2FIX V.2 model estimates total carbon balance of alternative management regimes in both even and uneven-aged forests, and thus has a wide applicability for both temperate and tropical conditions. Results for the model testing and validation in selected temperate and tropical forest management systems are presented and discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Bioaccumulation properties of many plants have been studied, although a very few reveal as a proper bioaccumulator plant for As. The Red clover, Trifolium pratense L. geographically widespread. The aim was conducted in order to determine the potential ability of this plant for cleaning up contaminated soil. Food grown on such lands usually contains heavy metals. Phytoremediation treatment of the soil prevents their entry into food, because it reduces the concentration of pollutants. Eighty-five Red clover one month old plants were grown in a nursery until transplant into the contaminated soil by inorganic As. Leaves and roots of 60 of plants sample were taken separately in every ten day during 60 days and analysed by ICP-OES while 25 samples were kept in different pH (8-4) in contaminated soil samples. Mean values of inorganic As(V) and As(III) in shoots and roots of plants were determined, and the statistical approaches were used for establishing the differences Bioaccumulation factor was calculated for As contents of plant parts for every 10 days. The soil arsenic level (19.09 mg/kg) higher than the global average (10.0 mg/kg), but within the maximum acceptable limit for agricultural soil (20.0 mg/kg) recommended by the European Union after 10 days. The lowest mean arsenic concentration was found after 40 days of cultivation of plant in pH=6 (1.01 mg/kg). It was observed that Red clover had suitable ability for phytoextraction method and soil recovery more Arsenic in pH<7 after 20-30 days of growth. The rate of As uptake by Red clover was significantly affected by the grown days after cultivated in contaminated treated (p<0.05) and pH of soil while up-taking in pH=6 (p-value <0.05).","[Ziarati, Parisa] Islamic Azad Univ, Tehran Med Sci, Nutr & Food Sci Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Vambol, Viola] Publ Agcy Natl Sci & Res Inst Ind Safety & Occupa, Kiev, Ukraine; [Vambol, Sergij] Kharkiv Petro Vasylenko Natl Tech Univ Agr, Kharkiv, Ukraine","Ziarati, P (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Tehran Med Sci, Nutr & Food Sci Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran.",ziarati.p@iaups.ac.ir,,,"Nutrition and Food Sciences Research Center, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University","Supports from Nutrition and Food Sciences Research Center, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University is gratefully acknowledged.",,20,1,1,0,0,WYDAWNICTWO UNIWERSYTETU MIKOLAJA KOPERNIKA,TORUN,"UL.

A maternal effect common in egg-laying vertebrates is provisioning of the yolk with carotenoids, organic pigments that often color sexual ornaments and are hypothesized to play positive and substantial physiological roles. In a recent study, yolks of great tit (Parus major) eggs were directly supplemented with carotenoids, and the effects on offspring fitness proxies measured (Marri and Richner in Oecologia 176:371-377, 2014a). Nestlings from supplemented broods were heavier early in development and more likely to fledge, but otherwise equivalent to control nestlings. The authors consider in detail the potential physiological mechanisms that might underlie this result, and here I expand on their Discussion by considering a non-exclusive explanation: that parents provided higher quality care to broods that received supplemental carotenoids. I discuss the general non-independence of pre- and post-hatching/parturition maternal effects when parents care for offspring, and then briefly review evidence that carotenoids specifically are tied to the intensity of avian begging displays. Finally, I detail how inclusive fitness opportunities and constraints shape the adaptive landscape in which maternal effects operate, highlighting both theoretical and applied concerns surrounding questions about the adaptiveness of maternal effects.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Dugas, MB (corresponding author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, DeGrace Hall,2080 Adelbert Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",matthew.b.dugas@gmail.com,,,,,,41,3,3,1,44,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,2015,177,4,,,,,1089,1092,,,,4,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CE0CD,25694043,,,,9/23/21,,

Furthermore, new JSDM implementations have been illustrated with different case studies, preventing direct comparisons of computational and statistical performance. We aim to resolve these outstanding issues by (a) highlighting similarities among seven presence-absence JSDMs using a clearly defined, singular notation; and (b) evaluating the computational and statistical performance of each JSDM using six datasets that vary widely in numbers of sites, species, and environmental covariates considered. Our singular notation shows that many of the JSDMs are very similar, and in turn parameter estimates of different JSDMs are moderate to strongly, positively correlated. In contrast, the different JSDMs clearly differ in computational efficiency and memory limitations. Our framework will allow ecologists to make educated decisions about the JSDM that best suits their objective, and enable wider uptake of JSDM methods among the ecological community.","[Wilkinson, David P.; Golding, Nick; Guillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta; Tingley, Reid; McCarthy, Michael A.] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic, Australia","Wilkinson, DP (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",davidpw@student.unimelb.edu.au,"Golding, Nick/ABD-1572-2020; Wilkinson, David/AAH-2705-2020; Guillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta/F-7461-2015; McCarthy, Michael/O-5655-2014","Wilkinson, David/0000-0002-9560-6499; Guillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta/0000-0002-8387-5739; Golding, Nick/0000-0001-8916-5570; McCarthy, Michael/0000-0003-1039-7980; Tingley, Reid/0000-0002-7630-7434","Australian Government Research Training ProgramAustralian Government; University of MelbourneUniversity of Melbourne; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DE160100904, DE170100601]","Australian Government Research Training Program; University of Melbourne; Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DE160100904 and DE170100601",,53,24,24,6,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

The conditions that govern exogenous food consumption by early peled larvae and largely determine the fate of a given generation depend on both biotic (the concentration of food organisms) and abiotic factors (wind regime). The trophic optimum during the transition of larvae to exogenous feeding, which ensures the level of gut filling sufficient for their survival and growth in the control water body, is determined by a complex of natural events.

Here we present diurnal and vertical patterns of water isotope ratios in forest air (delta H-2(v) and delta O-18(v)) not observed previously. Water vapor observed at three heights over 3 consecutive days in a coniferous forest in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, shows a stratified nocturnal structure of delta H-2(v) and delta O-18(v), with the most positive values consistently observed above the canopy (60 m). Differences between 0.5 m and 60 m range between 2-6aEuro degrees for delta O-18 and 20-40aEuro degrees for delta H-2 at night. Using a box model, we simulated H2O isotope fluxes and showed that the low to high delta H-2(v) and delta O-18(v) profiles can be explained by the vapor flux associated with evaporation from the forest floor and canopy transpiration. We used d-excess as a diagnostic tracer to identify processes that contribute to the diurnal variation in atmospheric moisture. Values of d-excess derived from water vapor measurements showed a repeated diel pattern, with the lowest values occurring in the early morning and the highest values occurring at midday. The isotopic composition of rain water, collected during a light rain event in the first morning of our experiment, suggested that considerable below-cloud secondary evaporation occurred during the descent of raindrops. We conclude that atmospheric entrainment appears to drive the isotopic variation of water vapor in the early morning when the convective boundary layer rapidly develops, while evapotranspiration becomes more important in the mid-afternoon as a primary moisture source of water vapor in this forest. Our results demonstrate the interplay between the effects of vegetation and boundary layer mixing under the influence of rain evaporation, which has implications for larger-scale predictions of precipitation across the terrestrial landscape.","[Lai, Chun-Ta] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Ehleringer, James R.] Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Lai, CT (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",lai@sciences.sdsu.edu,"Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010",,"office of Science (BER), US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-06ER64309]; National Institute for Climatic Change Research (NICCR); US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FC02-06ER64156]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [AGS-0956425]; Directorate For GeosciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [0956425] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank the two anonymous reviewers for their comments that improved the quality of this work.

Yet, how stressors shape the consistency ('repeatability') of traits and their covariation at the individual level remains debated. We studied how seasonal time constraints shape trait repeatability and integration of life-history, behavioural and physiological traits along a fast-slow continuum, using the 'pace-of-life syndrome' as a framework. We manipulated the photoperiod during the larval development of the damselfly Ischnura elegans, generating a time-relaxed early, a control, and a time-constrained late group. The photoperiod treatment did not seem to affect the voltinism of the larvae. As predicted, late-period larvae accelerated development and growth, yet this acceleration was no longer detectable for growth and metabolic rate during the final instar, possibly due to costs of the initial life-history acceleration. This warrants caution when inferring a species' pace-of-life based on a specific developmental stage. The late-period larvae were as predicted more active (only during the later stages of the final instar) and bolder than the control larvae, but not different from the early-period larvae. Most studies on time constraints only compared late and control animals, thereby potentially wrongly concluding adaptive responses to time constraints. Activity, boldness and body mass were repeatable, while growth and metabolic rates were not. Notably, repeatabilities did not change under time constraints. There was no support for an overall trait integration in a pace-of-life syndrome, yet activity and boldness covaried positively as expected. Importantly, this 'behavioural syndrome' was decoupled in the late-period larvae, which might be adaptive to enhance energy acquisition to fuel the accelerated development rate. Our results suggest that besides the predicted plastic acceleration of life-history, plastic changes in behavioural trait integration may also be an important but overlooked adaptive aspect of responding to time constraints.","[Tuzun, Nedim; Stoks, Robby] Univ Leuven, Evolutionary Stress Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Leuven, Belgium; [Savasci, Beste Basak] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Padua, Italy","Tuzun, N (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, Evolutionary Stress Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Leuven, Belgium.",nedim.tuzun@kuleuven.be,"Tuzun, Nedim/H-8114-2019","Tuzun, Nedim/0000-0002-4743-1743; Savasci, Beste Basak/0000-0002-9353-8883; Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459",FWO-FlandersFWO [G.0956.19]; KU Leuven grant [C16/17/002],"This work was supported by the research grant G.0956.19 from FWO-Flanders, and KU Leuven grant C16/17/002.",,94,1,1,2,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2021,130,2,,,,,274,286,,,20-Dec,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QA8IC,,Green Published,,,9/23/21,,

Juvenile pike (Esox lucius), a cannibalistic fish species, aggregates within habitat patches. The advantages to cannibals of aggregating in the absence of other predators and food constraints are not immediately obvious. In this study we explore the basis for this grouping by observing how spatial distributions of juvenile pike are mediated by the presence of conspecifics. 2. Solitary pike preferred shallow-water (0.17 m depth) habitats. When fish density was increased, the average time spent in alternative deep-water habitat (0.33 m) increased, consistent with a despotic type of distribution and suggesting that interference was occurring. 3. In pairs of fish, one pike, nominally the dominant individual, showed a habitat use similar to that of single fish. The second individual mostly occupied deep water, again consistent with a despotic distribution and apparently mediated by intimidation interference. However, dominant pike did on occasion enter deep water, at which times the subordinate pike remained with the dominant fish, appearing to aggregate in the pool. 4. We propose that habitat-specific risk could explain aggregations of pike in deep water. Although remaining in close proximity to dominant individuals in deep water would seemingly put subordinate fish at great risk, the alternative of moving to shallow water may increase risk still further by reducing the capacity to perceive and/or evade attacks.","Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Gatty Marine Lab, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; Fisheries Res Serv Freshwater Lab, Faskally PH16 5LB, Pitlochry, Scotland","Hawkins, LA (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Gatty Marine Lab, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland.",lh36@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Magurran, Anne E/D-7463-2013","Magurran, Anne/0000-0002-0036-2795; Armstrong, John/0000-0003-2015-0500",,,,49,15,16,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Although a number of studies have addressed responses of plant phenology to warming and altered precipitation individually, their interactions can alter plant phenology differently than either does independently. To explore how the interactions between global change drivers alter alpine ecosystems, we conducted a factorial experiment manipulating warming (ambient and +2 degrees C) and altered precipitation (50% decrease, control, and 50% increase) simultaneously in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. Over two years, we monitored plant phenological events, leafout day and first flowering day, for 11 common plant species that account for 74.4% of the total above biomass. Surprisingly, there was no interaction between warming and changes in precipitation on community plant phenology, but warming advanced leaf-out and first flowering day by 7.10 and 9.79 d, respectively. Unlike the community response, plant functional groups had a variety of direct and interactive responses to the experimental climate drivers. While the phenology of legumes was most influenced by temperature, temperature and precipitation interacted to alter the phenology of grasses and forbs. To explore how plant phenological sensitivity on the Tibetan Plateau is compared with other meadow ecosystems, we combined our dataset with a global plant phenology dataset. Interestingly, the phenological sensitivity of leaf-out day and first flowering day on the Tibetan Plateau is 7.3 and 37.8 times greater than global phenological sensitivity, respectively. This result highlights that a meta-analysis of global phenological sensitivity may significantly underestimate change in some regions-even regions as large as the Tibetan Plateau. Together, our results suggest that the Tibetan Plateau may experience rapid change as temperatures warm and that these changes will likely be more rapid than in other regions of the world. Further, our study highlights that if we are to make accurate predictions of how plant phenology may change with warming, we need to understand the specific environmental cues that drive phenological responses across different areas.","[Ji Suonan; He, Jin-Sheng] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc,Minist Educ, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ji Suonan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, 16 Lincui Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Ji Suonan; Classen, Aimee T.; Sanders, Nathan J.] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Classen, Aimee T.; Sanders, Nathan J.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Classen, Aimee T.; Sanders, Nathan J.] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [He, Jin-Sheng] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China","He, JS (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc,Minist Educ, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.; He, JS (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",jshe@pku.edu.cn,"Classen, Aimee/AAM-5671-2021; Classen, Aimee/X-2984-2019; Classen, Aimee T/C-4035-2008; Sanders, Nathan/ABE-4335-2020; Sanders, Nathan/A-6945-2009","Classen, Aimee T/0000-0002-6741-3470; Sanders, Nathan/0000-0001-6220-6731","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31570394, 31630009, 31800407]; National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954004, 2014CB954003]; Chinese Government Scholarship for Postgraduates, China Scholarship Council; Danish National Research FoundationDanmarks Grundforskningsfond; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Terrestrial Ecosystem Sciences programUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0010562]; 111 ProjectMinistry of Education, China - 111 Project [B14001]","Grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (#31570394, 31630009, 31800407) and the National Basic Research Program of China (#2014CB954004, 2014CB954003) supported this work.

The interest in AMF-nematode interactions ties in the possibility of enhanced resistance or tolerance of AMF-infected plants to nematodes, and the potential value of this for control of crop pests. Data collated from previous studies revealed a great diversity of AMF-nematode responses and we seek to generalise from these by evaluating and discussing interactions involving three groups of nematodes distinguished by their mode of parasitism: (i) ectoparasites; (ii) sedentary endoparasites; and (iii) migratory endoparasites. Based on proximity in tissue, we expected that the interactions between endoparasites and AMF would be stronger, i.e. more reciprocal effects of endoparasitic nematodes on AMF, than those between ectoparasites and AMF Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that, relative to AMF-free plants, AMF-infected plants were damaged more by ectoparasites than by endoparasites. Of the sedentary endoparasites, numbers of root-knot nematodes were reduced more by mycorrhizal. infection than were those of cyst nematodes. The reduction in nematode damage by AMF was not different for root-knot or cyst nematode infested plants. Migratory endoparasitic nematodes were the only group whose numbers were greater on AMF-infected plants. However, the experiments involving migratory nematodes were characterised by relatively high levels of AMF infection and little nematode damage compared to the other feeding types. The outcomes of the AMF-nematode interactions are determined by many factors during the interactions between organisms and their physical, physiological and temporal environments. Assessing effects by recording plant sizes and total nematode or AMF populations at the end of experiments gives very little information on the mechanisms of the interactions. It is time to stop doing studies of black boxes and time to start observing processes, directly by using microscopy and indirectly by application of molecular genetics.

In this article we propose a model of valuation with respect to conservation and restoration of nature. According to the model, valuation of nature can be characterized by a valuation approach, consisting of ecological, ethical and aesthetic perspectives. Such an approach includes scientific and normative aspects and leads to a particular claim of conservation. In this paper we discuss different perspectives, and accordingly, we sketch three main types of these valuation approaches.

Here, we overcame the problem of absent historical data by using resurrected seeds to capture historic plant-trait data for a number of plant regeneration and growth traits. We collected seed and seedling trait measurements from resurrected historic seeds and compared these with modern seed and seedling traits collected from the same species in the same geographic location. We found a total of 43 species from southeastern Australia for which modern/historic seed pairs could be located. These species were located in a range of regions that have undergone different amounts of climate change across a range of temperature, precipitation, and extreme measures of climate. There was a correlation between the amount of change in climate metrics, and the amount of change in plant traits. Using stepwise model selection, we found that for all regeneration and growth trait changes (except change in stem density), the most accurate model selected at least two measures of climate change. Changes in extreme measures of climate, such as heat-wave duration and changes in climate variability, were more strongly related to changes in regeneration and growth traits than changes in mean climate metrics. Across our species, for every 5% increase in temperature variability, there was a threefold increase in the probability of seed viability and seed germination success. An increase of 1 d in the maximum duration of dry spells through time led to a 1.5-fold decrease in seed viability and seeds became 30% flatter/thinner. Regions where the maximum heat-wave duration had increased by 10 d saw a 1.35-cm decrease in seedling height and a 1.04-g decrease in seedling biomass. Rapid responses in plant traits to changes in climate may be possible; however, it is not clear whether these changes will be fast enough for plants to keep pace with future climate change.","[Everingham, Susan E.; Moles, Angela T.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Everingham, Susan E.; Offord, Catherine A.] Australian Bot Garden, Australian PlantBank, Royal Bot Gardens & Domain Trust, Mt Annan, NSW 2567, Australia; [Sabot, Manon E.

Trait-based models of ecological communities typically assume intraspecific variation in functional traits is not important, although such variation can change species trait rankings along gradients in resources and environmental conditions, and thus influence community structure and function. 2. We examined the degree of intraspecific relative to interspecific variation, and reaction norms of 11 functional traits for 57 forest understorey plant species, including: intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE), Delta N-15, five leaf traits, two stem traits and two root traits along gradients in light, nitrogen, moisture and understorey cover. 3. Our results indicate that interspecific trait variation exceeded intraspecific variation by at least 50% for most, but not all traits. Intraspecific variation in Delta N-15, iWUE, leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and root traits was high (47-70%) compared with most leaf traits and stem traits (13-38%). 4. Delta N-15 varied primarily along gradients in abiotic conditions, while light and understorey cover were relatively less important. Intrinsic water-use efficiency was related primarily to light transmission, reflecting increases in photosynthesis relative to stomatal conductance. Leaf traits varied mainly as a function of light availability, with some reaction norms depending on understorey cover. Plant height increased with understorey cover, while stem-specific density was related primarily to light. Resources, environmental conditions and understorey cover did not contribute strongly to the observed variation in root traits. 5. Gradients in resources, environmental conditions and competition all appear to control intraspecific variability in most traits to some extent. However, our results suggest that species cross-over (i.e. trait rank reversals) along the gradients measured here are generally not a concern. 6. Intraspecific variability in understorey plant species traits can be considerable. However, trait data collected under a narrow range of environmental conditions appears sufficient to establish species rankings and scale between community and ecosystem levels using trait-based models. Investigators may therefore focus on obtaining a sufficient sample size within a single set of conditions rather than characterizing trait variation across entire gradients to optimize sampling efforts.","[Burton, Julia I.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Perakis, Steven S.] US Geol Survey, Forest & Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Corvallis, OR USA; [McKenzie, Sean C.] Montana State Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Lawrence, Caitlin E.] Oregon State Univ, Inst Nat Resources, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Puettmann, Klaus J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Burton, JI (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",julia.burton@usu.edu,"Burton, Julia/C-8395-2009","Burton, Julia/0000-0002-3205-8819","U.S. Bureau of Land Management [L15AC00009, L16AC00284]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, McIntire Stennis project [229410, UTA01305]","This research was supported with funding from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (Financial Assistance Agreement No. L15AC00009 to K.J.P. and J.I.B. and L16AC00284 to J.I.B.).

To examine the importance of this mechanism, I tested the following three hypotheses in a field experiment in 1990: (H-1) Folivory by the leaf beetle Trirhabda canadensis (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) increases availability of light, water, and N in monocultures of goldenrod (Solidago missouriensis). This hypothesis was partially supported. Folivory by Trirhabda reduced leaf, root, and total biomass of goldenrod and increased light penetration, soil water content, and soil nitrate concentration. However, Trirhabda grazing did not affect overall soil N availability. (H-2) The invasion of goldenrod monocultures by other plant species and the response of goldenrod to folivory reflects an increased availability of resources in monocultures grazed by Trirhabda. This hypothesis was supported. Folivory by Trirhabda raised the probability that a species would invade the experimental monocultures and increased the species richness of the invading plant assemblage. Relative growth rate of goldenrod and production of aboveground biomass by invaders were higher in monocultures grazed by Trirhabda than in ungrazed ones. Prostrate and creeping forbs increased in relative abundance following folivory by Trirhabda. (H-3) Reduced N uptake by goldenrod or increased N mineralization accompanies increased N availability in grazed monocultures. This hypothesis was also supported. Net N mineralization and nitrification were higher in monocultures grazed by Trirhabda than in ungrazed monocultures. Folivory by Trirhabda larvae reduced N uptake by goldenrod, but that of adults did not. The impact of herbivores upon plant communities may be effected through increased availability of important plant resources.","UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT ECOL & BEHAV BIOL, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA",,,,,,,,119,47,48,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1994,75,6,,,,,1673,1683,,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PE267,,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

The decomposition rates of 3 species typical to undisturbed fens and 3 species that spontaneously colonize harvested fens were assessed. These species were incubated in both a restoration site (harvested fen) and an undisturbed fen to compare decomposition according to different environmental conditions. The average exponential decay coefficient (k) for all material types was slightly higher (circa 0.04.y(-1) higher) in the harvested fen than those observed in the undisturbed fen. However, the litter type (leaves, roots/rhizomes, or bryophyte fragments) had the largest impact on the decomposition rates. The 2 tested bryophytes had lower k-values (between 0.14 and 0.11 for Polytrichum strictum and 0.06 for Sphagnum centrale) than the vascular plant litter (between 0.25 and 0.50). The annual primary production of the tested species was also measured to estimate the peat-accumulating capacity of each species. Scirpus cyperinus had an annual primary production that was 3 times higher (1500 g.m(-2).y(-1)) than the other species (between 300 and 550 g.m(-2).y(-1)). Estimates show that the harvested fen has a high peat-accumulating potential due to the high biomass production observed at this site.","[Rochefort, Line] Univ Laval, Peatland Ecol Res Grp, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Nord, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada","Rochefort, L (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Peatland Ecol Res Grp, Pavillon Paul Comtois,2425 Rue Agr, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",line.rochefort@fsaa.ulaval.ca,,,,,,60,25,25,0,30,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1195-6860,2376-7626,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2009,16,2,,,,,158,166,,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,463XS,,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

In Australia's rangelands, the integrity of these patterns and processes have been modified by clearing, grazing and fire. Intuitively, biodiversity should be strongly related to functional integrity; that is, landscapes with high functional integrity should maintain biodiversity, and altered, less functional landscapes may lose some biodiversity, defined here as the variety and abundance of the plants, animals and microorganisms of concern. Simple indicators of biodiversity and functional integrity are needed that can be monitored at a range of scales, from fine to coarse. In the present paper, we use examples, primarily from published work on Australia's rangeland, to document that at finer patch and hillslope scales several indicators of landscape functional integrity have been identified. These indicators, based on the quantity and quality of vegetation patches and interpatch zones, are related to biodiversity. For example, a decrease in the cover and width (quantity) and condition (quality) of vegetation patches, and an increase in bare soil (quantity of interpatch) near cattle watering points in a paddock are significantly related to declines in plant and grasshopper diversity. These vegetation patch-cover and bare-soil indicators have been monitored traditionally by field-based methods, but new high-resolution, remote-sensing imagery can be used in specific rangeland areas for this fine-scale monitoring. At intermediate paddock and small watershed scales, indicators that can be derived from medium-resolution remote-sensing are also needed for efficient monitoring of rangeland condition (i.e. functional integrity) and biodiversity. For example, 30-100-m-pixel Landsat imagery has been used to assess the condition of rangelands along grazing gradients extending from watering-points. The variety and abundance of key taxa have been related to these gradients (the Biograze project). At still larger region and catchment scales, indicators of rangeland functional integrity can also be monitored by coarse-resolution remote-sensing and related to biodiversity. For example, the extent and greenness (condition) of different regional landscapes have been monitored with 1-km-pixel satellite imagery. This regional information becomes more valuable when it indicates differences as a result of land management. Finally, we discuss potential future developments that could improve proposed indicators of landscape functional integrity and biodiversity, thereby improving our ability to monitor rangelands effectively.","Trop Savannas CRC, Atherton, Qld 4883, Australia; CSIRO, Atherton, Qld 4883, Australia; CSIRO, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; CSIRO, Alice Springs, NT, Australia","Ludwig, JA (corresponding author), Trop Savannas CRC, POB 780, Atherton, Qld 4883, Australia.",john.ludwig@csiro.au,"James, Craig/D-7001-2011; Ludwig, John/D-4686-2011; Bastin, Gary/A-2945-2011; Noojipady, Praveen/B-2511-2010","Bastin, Gary/0000-0002-5583-1368;",,,,70,72,74,2,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,FEB,2004,29,1,,,,,108,120,,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,801JC,,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

Previous studies of the Medium Ground Finch, Geospiza fortis, have documented that selection is most severe under drought conditions, which generally favour beaks that are comparatively deep and narrow. Deep beaks are presumed to enhance a bird's ability to crack hard seeds, and narrow beaks have been proposed to enhance a bird's efficiency in manipulating seeds. 2. In the present study, we make the first direct measurements of bite force in Darwin's finches. We used 147 G. fortis from Isla Santa Cruz, Galapagos, to document the influence of beak, head and body dimensions on bite force. 3. Among the various beak dimensions, depth, width and shape were all significant predictors of bite force. Among the various head dimensions, width was the best predictor of bite force. Generally low predictive values of multiple regression models including all morphological variables, as well as positive allometric scaling of bite force on head width, suggest an important additional role for variation in muscle architecture or jaw biomechanics in bite force generation.","Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Grad Program Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada","Herrel, A (corresponding author), Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",aherrel@uia.ua.ac.be,"Herrel, Anthony/C-3712-2013; Hendry, Andrew/C-5765-2008; Podos, Jeff/I-3843-2019","Herrel, Anthony/0000-0003-0991-4434; Hendry, Andrew/0000-0002-4807-6667; Podos, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2546-7999",,,,19,146,152,0,114,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Xylem water potential and leaf conductance were also examined to identify the trees' response to using these sources of water. Trees at distances greater than about 15 m from the stream used no stream water. The trees used groundwater in summer and a combination of groundwater and rain-derived surface-soil water (0.05-0.15 m depth) in winter. In doing so they suffered water stress at electrical conductivities higher than approximately 40 dS m-1 (equivalent to approximately - 1.4 MPa).

The prevailing notion is that this occurs because size, morphology and weaponry determine the relative effectiveness of alternative strategies, and nowhere is this assumption more entrenched than in our view of the basic decision to stay, fight or flee. Here, we use observations of coyote (Canis latrans) packs hunting deer in winter to show that two ungulates of similar size and morphology, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (O. hemionus), use different antipredator strategies when encountered or attacked. Mule deer typically responded by holding their ground and aggressively defending con-specifics, and were at high risk of being attacked and killed if they fled or were undefended. White-tails always fled when pursued or attacked by coyotes. Coyotes pursued fewer white-tails than mule deer they encountered regardless of prey response. Once pursued or attacked, white-tails faced a risk of attack and capture, respectively, that was intermediate between the high and low risk mule deer groups. The overall risk of capture per encounter for white-tails was similar to that facing mule deer that confronted coyotes, which was much lower than risk facing mule deer that fled and were undefended. Contextual variables such as the opportunity to improve one's position by joining another group, moving to rugged terrain, or the presence of companions that are willing to provide defense may explain why a mixed strategy is maintained in mule deer, despite the apparently detrimental effects of flight. These examples illustrate the value of including prey behavior in models of hunting success in so far as prey defenses may not be coupled with differences in size and morphology.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Large Anim Res Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; Univ Lethbridge, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada","Lingle, S (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Large Anim Res Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",susan.lingle@uleth.ca,,,,,,71,83,84,0,51,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2002,131,1,,,,,154,164,,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,538QD,28547505,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

Litter size at weaning in a large natural population (mean = 3.51 pups/litter, 248 litters) was significantly lower than the litter size (6 pups) that produced the most offspring surviving to yearling age class. This evidence contradicted Lack's ''optimal litter size'' hypothesis, which predicts that the most productive litter size should approximate the mean. Litter size had no significant effect on the subsequent survival or reproduction of mothers, contrary to the negative effects predicted by the ''cost of reproduction'' hypothesis. Litter success varied among years, and good and bad years for reproduction could be experimentally simulated with food supplementations. However, small samples of the largest litters rendered the ''bad-years'' hypothesis inappropriate for application to our data. Proportional survival of offspring was relatively constant among different litter sizes, contrary to the necessary condition of the ''cliff edge'' hypothesis of a dramatic decrease in survival of young from the largest litters. The data supported the ''individual optimization'' hypothesis most strongly. As predicted, the number of surviving offspring increased with litter size, although in one population the six largest litters (2.4% of 248 litters) suffered reduced success. In natural and food-supplemented populations, changes in maternal body mass were associated with changes in litter size (r = 0.205 to 0.926). Because survival of young remained relatively constant as litter size increased, these correlations resulted in greater offspring success for mothers in better body condition.","SAVANNAH RIVER ECOL LAB, AIKEN, SC 29802 USA; AUBURN UNIV, ALABAMA AGR EXPT STN, AUBURN, AL 36849 USA; UNIV ALBERTA, DEPT ZOOL, EDMONTON, AB T6G 2E9, CANADA","RISCH, TS (corresponding author), AUBURN UNIV, DEPT ZOOL & WILDLIFE SCI, AUBURN, AL 36849 USA.",,"Dobson, F.

Despite the potential competitive advantages, extended leaf duration also subjects non-native species to possible hydraulic risks associated with maintaining leaves during periods of increased frost probability. It remains unclear how non-native species are able to maintain xylem function within this context. Leaf phenology in temperate deciduous trees has been shown to be a function of xylem anatomy, with earlier bud break associated with smaller xylem vessels due to the presumed resistance of smaller vessels to freezing-induced cavitation. We examined relationships between leaf phenology and xylem vessel traits across 82 native and non-native understorey deciduous woody species common to eastern U.S. deciduous forests. We hypothesized that non-native species possess xylem vessel traits associated with maximum hydraulic safety during frost-prone spring and autumn leaf display without compromising rapid growth rate. Larger metaxylem vessels in non-native species were associated with both faster spring growth and delayed autumn leaf fall compared to native species. Non-native species also had smaller latewood vessel diameter, latewood vessel area percentage and a higher proportion of solitary vessels in the entire secondary xylem cross section compared to natives, potentially increasing their resistance to freezing- and/or drought-induced cavitation in autumn, thus allowing for delayed autumn leaf fall. Native and non-native species exhibited similar dates of spring bud break and leaf emergence, consistent with similar xylem vessel size and vessel area percentage within metaxylem and earlywood. Within both groups, species with earlier bud and leaf emergence had a higher total percentage of vessel area within metaxylem and earlywood. This suggests understorey species need sufficient water to support their early spring growth at the risk of freezing-induced cavitation. Our study suggests xylem vessel properties, along with cross-sectional spatial xylem vessel distribution, reflect the capacity of non-native plants to thrive in a new environment and deepen our understanding of the physiological mechanisms of successful invasions of non-native understorey woody plant species.","[Yin, Jingjing; Smith, Maria S.; Bauerle, Taryn L.] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, 134A Plant Sci Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Fridley, Jason D.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, 448 Life Sci Complex, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA","Bauerle, TL (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, 134A Plant Sci Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",bauerle@cornell.edu,,,Syracuse University,"We thank Meghan Horne for help with embedding and sectioning tissue samples, John Zhao for field help and A.

However, diverse modes of parasite competition (resource-based, antagonism, immunity manipulation) can lead to adaptations with different implications for virulence. Using an experimental evolution approach we investigated the hypothesis that selection in mixed-strain infections will lead to increased antagonism that trades off against investment in virulence. Selection in mixed infections led to improved suppression of competitors in the bacterial insect pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis. Increased antagonism was associated with decreased virulence in three out of four selected lines. Moreover, mixed infections were less virulent than single-strain infections, and between-strain competition tended to decrease pathogen growth in vivo and in vitro. Spiteful interactions among these bacteria may be favoured because of the high metabolic costs of virulence factors and the high risk of mixed infections.","[Garbutt, Jennie; Bonsall, Michael B.; Raymond, Ben] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Math Ecol Res Grp, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Wright, Denis J.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Nat Sci, Div Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Raymond, Ben] Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Raymond, B (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Math Ecol Res Grp, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",ben.raymond@rhul.ac.uk,"Garbutt, Jennie/G-5013-2012; Raymond, Ben/F-5872-2011","Garbutt, Jennie/0000-0002-6148-6847; Bonsall, Michael/0000-0003-0250-0423",BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/C512702/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/E012671/2] Funding Source: researchfish,"This work was supported by BBSRC, NERC and the Royal Society.

Because most moths are nocturnal and easily attracted to lights, the utilization of consistent and uniform sampling methods based on a set of standardized protocols can lead to creation of comparable datasets on regional to global scales. These datasets can be used to address environmental issues such as the biological impacts resulting from climate change and land-use policies. More than 60% of the Korean peninsula is mountainous, and the forests on most mountains are undergoing marked changes related to forest succession and recent climatic variability. Therefore, the present study was conducted to monitor macromoth communities in a mountain ecosystem of Korea. Our study site, Mt. Jirisan National Park is the first national park and the highest mountain on the mainland of South Korea. This mountain range runs 34 km east to west and 26 km north to south, harboring more than 1,400 vascular plant and more than 3,000 insect species. We monitored macromoth communities at six sites in Mt. Jirisan National Park, South Korea from 2005 to 2017, during which time moths were collected from May to October using an ultraviolet bucket trap. The generated dataset, which contains 1,089 species and 40,694 individuals in 20 families, can be used to establish a baseline for development of a network-oriented database to assess the temporal and spatial changes of moths in temperate and tropical forests and the biotic impact of environmental change.","[Choi, Sei-Woong; Kim, Nang-Hee] Mokpo Natl Univ, Dept Environm Educ, Muan 58554, Jeonnam, South Korea; [An, Jeong-Seop; Lee, Sanghun; Ahn, Nahyun] Natl Inst Ecol, Team Climate Change Res, Seocheon, South Korea","Choi, SW (corresponding author), Mokpo Natl Univ, Dept Environm Educ, Muan 58554, Jeonnam, South Korea.",choisw@mokpo.ac.kr,,"Choi, Sei-Woong/0000-0001-6326-399X",National Institute of Ecology [NIE-2018-21]; National Research Foundation of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea [2018R1D1A1B07046637],"National Institute of Ecology, Grant/Award Number: NIE-2018-21; National Research Foundation of Korea, Grant/Award Number: 2018R1D1A1B07046637",,0,1,1,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

The present study aims for mapping the ichthyofaunal diversity of an unexplored river Luni and its relationship with habitat parameters based on field surveys conducted from October, 2018 to November, 2019. The diverse habitats of river Luni support 27 fish species and the highest diversity was recorded from midstream segment (19 species) followed by downstream (14 species). The index of diversity (H' = 2.35) and dominance (D = 0.133) indicated rich fish diversity and even distribution. The relational analysis of habitat variables with abundance of cyprinids revealed, altitude and oxidation reduction potential as the key drivers for its distribution in the upstream segment of the river. This study provides an evidence for establishment of invasive species especially Oreochromis mossambicus and its impact on the fish assemblage structure of arid river Luni. The major anthropogenic factors threatening biodiversity and pristine habitats are mining, release of effluents and excess canal water, unplanned developmental activities in the riparian corridor and establishment of non-native species. The baseline information generated on fish assemblage pattern and habitat status of the river Luni can assist in formulating strategies for the conservation and management of this riverine ecosystem to support the livelihood of local communities.","[Pathak, Ajey Kumar; Kantharajan, G.; Kumar, Ravi; Dayal, Rajesh; Mohindra, Vindhya; Lal, Kuldeep K.] ICAR Natl Bur Fish Genet Resources, Lucknow 226002, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Saini, V.

Comparative studies conducted at multiple locations enable the general importance of processes to be assessed. However, spatial or temporal variation in the strength of local ecological relationships frequently makes it difficult to draw general conclusions, as increasing the extent of a study is likely to increase the physical and biological heterogeneity. To unravel the influence of differences in wave climate on local ecological interactions among adult and juvenile sandflat bivalves, an experiment was conducted at three sites in each of three harbors in the North Island of New Zealand. The selected sites covered a range of wind-wave exposures but were all mid-intertidal sandflats with macrobenthic communities dominated by bivalves. Four treatments were used additions of 0, 15, 45, and 110 adults of the tellinid bivalve Macomona liliana. At each site a DOBIE wave gauge was used to provide time-series data on wave orbital speed at the seabed over the 35-d duration of the experiment. Significant experiment x location interactions indicated site-dependent variation in the strength and direction of treatment effects. However, multiple regression models based on site environmental characteristics were very successful in explaining differences between sites in the strength of experimental treatment effects (66-99% of the variance explained). We used the cube of the orbital wave velocity at the seabed (U-b(3)) as an index of energy dissipation by waves. Both the site average and maximum U-b(3) were important variables explaining location-dependent treatment effects. Average U-b(3) increased the strength of the negative effects of experimental additions of adult Macomona on juvenile bivalves, presumably by increasing the opportunity for juvenile bivalves to be resuspended by small waves and transported away from areas with high adult densities. Maximum U-b(3) decreased the strength of the experimental effects, probably by increasing the purely passive transport of juveniles with sediment bedload and thus obliterating patterns in the distribution of juvenile bivalves relative to adult Macomona. Hence, different aspects of the wave climate influenced adult-juvenile interactions in different ways. Ambient density of adult Macomona around the experimental sites was also an important factor. This multisite experiment confirmed the importance of local adult-juvenile interactions and suggested ways in which these interactions are influenced by local environmental characteristics. Where the influence of such broad-scale variables can be identified, linking broad-scale information to small-scale studies that identify mechanisms can increase the generality of ecological experiments.","Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Hamilton, New Zealand; Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Auckland, New Zealand","Thrush, SF (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, POB 11-115, Hamilton, New Zealand.",,"Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012","Thrush, Simon/0000-0002-4005-3882; Cummings, Vonda/0000-0003-1076-3995",,,,96,76,77,1,25,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2000,81,2,,,,,399,415,,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,279ZM,,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

We compared the effects of seed mass on seedling size (biomass), maximum relative growth rate (RGR), the proportion of emerged seedlings that survived until one year of age, and the proportion of Sown seeds reaching the stage of one-year-old seedlings in gaps compared with shaded rain forest habitats, as well as in contrasting greenhouse, light conditions. For each species, seeds were classified into four seed mass categories and introduced to three pairs of shaded forest gap sites. In the greenhouse, emerged seedlings from different seed mass categories were grown in contrasting light environments. A positive effect of seed mass on seedling survival was observed in six of seven species in the shaded forest but only in two species in gaps. Final seedling biomass was positively related to seed mass in five species in the shaded forest, but only in two species in gaps. In some species,RGR decreased with seed mass. Consequently, the biomass achieved by small-seeded seedlings with relatively fast growth rates was similar to that of seedlings derived from large seeds. The probability of recruitment increased with seed mass in four of seven species in the shaded forest, but only in two species in gaps. Negative effects of seed mass on recruitment occurred only in one species, and only in gaps. The positive effects of seed mass on seedling biomass and survival observed under shaded greenhouse conditions were weaker than those observed in the shaded forest. Overall, our results indicate that: (1) seed mass influences recruitment in natural forest habitats, (2) larger seeds confer higher probability of recruitment in the shaded forest by producing seedlings with larger size and higher probability of survival, and (3) in natural habitats ecological factors in addition to light (e.g., seed predators) operated selectively on seedlings emerging from seeds differing in mass.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Recursos Nat, Morelia 58089, Michoacan, Mexico; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Paz, H (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Recursos Nat, Apartado Postal 27-3 Xangari, Morelia 58089, Michoacan, Mexico.",hpaz@ate.oikos.unam.mx,"Martinez-Ramos, Miguel/G-8451-2019","Martinez-Ramos, Miguel/0000-0002-7785-1917; Paz, Horacio/0000-0001-5221-0905",,,,47,79,94,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2003,84,2,,,,,439,450,,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,654FB,,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

Since crossing distance is an attribute of a specific combination of parents, its effect on seed set represents an interaction of these parents, and since genetic similarity declines with physical distance in D. nelsonii populations, the interaction reflects parental genetic similarity. Understanding processes responsible for the effect is simplified if seed set differences result from prezygotic events, because in this case no inbreeding or outbreeding depression are involved. In 1990 we observed pollen tubes after performing crosses between plants separated by 1 m, 10 m, or 100 m, and found that the intermediate, 10 m crosses delivered the most tubes to the ovary. A combined analysis of the 1990 experiment and three earlier experiments showed that this prezygotic difference in performance is significant and of the same magnitude as seed set differences. Disproportionate failure of pollen tubes in 1 and 100 m crosses seems likely to reflect a trait of the maternal parent rather than of pollen, because the kinship of haploid pollen to a zygote it has fertilized always exceeds maternal kinship to that zygote. Thus the conditions for ''pollen suicide'' to evolve by natural selection are more restrictive than those for ''female choice'' to evolve, and the latter is more likely to control the outcome of the parental interaction.","ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA","WASER, NM (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF RIVERSIDE, DEPT BIOL, RIVERSIDE, CA 92521 USA.",,,,,,,45,60,60,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,1993,68,2,,,,,303,308,,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MJ666,,,,,9/23/21,,9/23/21

The duration of an outbreak is expected to depend on the subsequent development of this abundance; however, prediction is nontrivial due to the complexity of the gerbil-plague system. The aim of this study was to investigate how the duration of outbreaks depends on different types of host population dynamics generated from: a cyclic model; an autoregressive model giving irregular fluctuations; and a simple model with uncorrelated fluctuations. For each model, outbreak duration was studied under various levels of mean and variability of host abundance. Its focus on the effect of different gerbil dynamics sets this study apart from the few published studies on diseases in dynamic host populations. Plague outbreaks were simulated in a cellular automaton model based on statistical analysis of archived records of plague and host abundance. Temporal autocorrelation was found to make outbreak duration less sensitive to changes in mean abundance than uncorrelated fluctuations. Cyclicity had little effect on the mean duration of outbreaks, but resulted in a multimodal distribution. For all three types of gerbil dynamics, increased variability in gerbil abundance reduced the duration of outbreaks when the mean abundance was high (paralleling results on the risk of species extinction in fluctuating environments), but increased their duration when the mean abundance was lower. Spatial heterogeneity was briefly tested and produced longer outbreaks than the homogenous case. The results are relevant to predicting plague activity in populations of great gerbils.","[Viljugrein, Hildegunn] Norwegian Vet Inst, N-0106 Oslo, Norway; [Heier, Lise; Viljugrein, Hildegunn] Univ Oslo, CEES, Dept Biosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Storvik, Geir O.] Univ Oslo, Dept Math, N-0316 Oslo, Norway","Heier, L (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, CEES, Dept Biosci, POB 1066 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",lh@liseheier.net,"Viljugrein, Hildegunn/N-6657-2015","Storvik, Geir Olve/0000-0001-8198-1426",,,,47,2,2,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

However, little is known about changes of bacterial community among the microfeatures within thermokarst area. Results: We investigated bacterial communities using the Illumina sequencing method and examined their relationships with soil parameters in a thermokarst feature on the northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We categorized the ground surface into three different micro-relief patches based on the type and extent of permafrost collapse (control, collapsing and subsided areas). Permafrost collapse significantly decreased the soil carbon density and moisture content in the upper 10 cm samples in the collapsing areas. The highest loading factors for the first principal component (PC) extracted from the soil parameters were soil carbon and nitrogen contents, while soil moisture content and C:N ratios were the highest loading factors for the second PC. The relative abundance of Acidobacteria decreased with depth. Bacterial diversity in subsided areas was higher than that in control areas. Conclusions: Bacterial community structure was significantly affected by pH and depth. The relative abundance of Gemmatimonadetes and Firmicutes were significantly correlated with the first and second PCs extracted from multiple soil parameters, suggesting these phyla could be used as indicators for the soil parameters in the thermokarst terrain.","[Wu, Xiaodong; Zhao, Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resource, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Cryosphere Res Stn Qinghai Tibetan Plateau, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Haiyan; Liu, Guimin] Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Environm & Municipal Engn, Lanzhou 730070, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Mu, Cuicui] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Western Chinas Environm Syst, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China","Wu, XD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resource, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Cryosphere Res Stn Qinghai Tibetan Plateau, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",wuxd@lzb.ac.cn,"Zhao, Lin/M-9536-2018; mu, cuicui/AAU-2733-2020","Zhao, Lin/0000-0003-0245-8413; mu, cuicui/0000-0003-0630-9423","State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences [SKLCS-ZZ-2018]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41721091, 41661013, 41871060, 41601063]; CASChinese Academy of Sciences [QYZDY-SSW-DQC021]; Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities of China [lzujbky-2017-223]","This work was financially supported by the State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences (SKLCS-ZZ-2018), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41721091, 41661013, 41871060, 41601063).

In this study, we used ingrowth cores to investigate the impacts of regular rotation of the cores, defaunation and nitrogen addition on AMF, microbial biomass and microarthropods in the fermentation/humus (F/H) and litter (L) layers of an Ecuadorian montane tropical rainforest. AMF were substantially reduced in the F/H layer (to 34% of initial), while in the L layer they remained constant during the experiment. Overall, microorganisms and microarthropods were largely independent of AMF hyphae and their exudates, however, defaunation strongly affected the recovery of their communities. Nitrogen addition increased the quality of litter material and beneficially affected microbial communities thereby increasing decomposition rates, but did not impact AMF abundance and microarthropod communities. These findings suggest that the cutoff of the carbon supply from the plant to the fungal mycelium was not compensated by switching resources in the F/H layer, underlining a strong association between AMF and living roots. While in the L layer, AMF likely competed with saprotrophic microorganisms for litter-derived resources at intermediate stages of decomposition pointing to indirect contributions of AMF to decomposition processes. Overall, the results support the view that root-derived resources are important in fueling soil food webs, but also indicate that in the studied montane rainforest these resources are only available close to roots and not channeled distant to roots via AMF.","[Sanchez-Galindo, Laura M.; Maraun, Mark; Scheu, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, Gottingen, Germany; [Camenzind, Tessa] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Berlin, Germany; [Scheu, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use, Gottingen, Germany","Sanchez-Galindo, LM (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, Gottingen, Germany.",lsanche@uni-goettingen.de,,"Sanchez-Galindo, Laura M./0000-0002-6403-8329",,,,94,4,4,2,19,SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS,JODHPUR,"5A, NEW PALI RD, JODHPUR, RAJASTHAN 342 001, INDIA",0564-3295,2661-8982,,TROP ECOL,Trop.
